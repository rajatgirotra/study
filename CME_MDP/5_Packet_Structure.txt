Packet structure is very simple. This is the structure of the UDP data inside the UDP packet.

1) Packet Sequence Number: Each packet has a sequence number, The sequence number is unique per channel.
2) Sending Time (Nanos) : This nano comes from the matching engine clock.

3) Repeating Messages:
   a) Message size
   b) Block Length
   c) Template ID to use to decode
   d) Schema Id to use to decode
   e) Version
   f) FIX Message.

A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:
=====================

CME only sends incremental book update. This means that if some-one sends an order 
for Buy 50@9850, then this will result in a single 35=X messages which says "Add Bid Level 1 GEU5 50@9850".
It is our CME library which maintains its own internal book and gives you the current state of the book via the OnMktQuote()
or onMktTrade() functions.
