CME has a Market Data Platform (MDP) called Globex MPD3 which provides event based market data.
which means it provides (desseminates) data to its client based on events occuring on the exchange like Trade, BookUpdate, Reset, Recovery, InstrumentDefinition etc.

Market data includes:
1) Bids & Asks (basically Top of Book or Market level or Book Updates or Market Depth.. call it whatever)
2) Trade information
3) Market Statistical information
4) Start of week book population 

It also provides and recovery and support services for market data processing

Also market data is xferred using SBE (Simple Binary Encoding) which is based on primitive encoding, 
optimized for low bandwidth, low latency and direct data access.

SBE is nothing but a simple way of encoding & decoding information sent by exchange. Most of this information is nothing but FIX messages.

Advantages:

Data is xferred in UDP packets. Each packet can have multiple messages which are nothing but FIX messages. However each message completely resides in one UDP
packet and is never broken down into multiple packets. An event at the exchange can be one or multiple packets.
Each event has a type (BookUpdate, Trade etc) followed by one or more packets containing messages for that event.
Each FIX message also has an indicator whether there are more messages to follow for that event.

So the FIX messages are basically SBE encoded.

Also since each packet has complete fix message, you can process the packet as soon as you fetch it.
You dont have to wait for subseqent packets 

Also you have Fixed length fields, which means that you dont have to parse the message.
Rather you can just access the message based on offsets. We'll see shortly how this is done.
