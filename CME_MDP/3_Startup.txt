How to begin processing of Market data at the beginning of the week.
In CME, mostly markets open on Sunday evening and we should follow the following procedure.

1) Download the schema file and channel configuration on Sunday before market open. This will be used to correctly decode market data and subscribe to the write channels.
2) Listen to the incremental feed for incremental market data.

Typically at start of week. CME will do the following
1) First send a fix message (35=f, Market security status) with tag 326-SecurityTradingStatus=21 (Pre-open).
   MAKE SURE A MARKET PARTICIPANT DOES NOT SEND AND ORDER TO CME BEFORE RECEIVING 35-f, else it results in disciplinary action.
2) After that it send multiple (35=d, security definition) messages, with tag 980=SecurityUpdateAction = "Add" even if the security was already there in the last week.

So each week is a fresh week.

For mid week startup, you there is some recovery process which I am skipping for now, Will come back to it later.
