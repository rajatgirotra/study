There are various products for which market data is distributed. CME divides these products into separate groups called channels or market data group.
All information regarding that product will be available on that channel.

In each channel there are multiple UDP feeds described below.

1) Incremental Feed: CME provides two UDP feeds A and B for incremental market data using encoded FIX messages.
    The following are some fix message types that are supported.

    a) SecurityDefinition message 35=d
    b) Market data security message 35=f
    c) Market data incremental refresh 35=X
    d) Request for quote 35=R

    All this information is provided on both A and B feeds to minimize packet loss. Ideally clients should
    1) Listen to both Incremental Feeds A and B.
    2) Process packets based on incremental sequence numbers
    3) Discard packets if sequence number has already been processed.
    4) If a gap is detected, it means packet loss occurred on both feeds and clients must initiate a recovery procedure.

2) Market Recovery Feed: feeds A and B.
   The mark recovery feed is used to distribute market data snapshot messages (35=?) for all books on that channel that have activity since the beginning of the week.
   Feed B is only used in case Feed A is non-operational. Each UDP packet again can have multiple snapshot messages.

3) Instrument Definition Feed: A and B
   Same as above but instead of snaphot messages it has security/instrument definition messages (35=d).

4) TCP relay: This is used to request CME to replay a set of packets already sent by CME on the Incremental Feed. For this CME will be the acceptor and we will be the initiator.
   We will need to send a Market data request message (35=V) specifying the start an end packet sequence numbers to be replayed. CME will send the information and close the TCP connection.


CME also provides something called "Market data Services" which provide kind of meta-data needed to process the market data coming on the channels above.
Eg
1) Schema Distribution - A method of providing all the currently active template specifications. See below for details.
2) Channel Configurations
3) Security Definition flat file.
4) Market schedule file - Contains timing information for securities for the current week.

This service is nothing but an FTP service where you can download the above meta-data for all three environments. "Cert", "Next Release", or "Production"

1) Schema definitions: This is an XML file that is used to decode information sent on the incremental data feed. Get it here:
    a) For Production: ftp://ftp.cmegroup.com/SBEFix/Production/Templates/templates_FixBinary.xml
                       curl -O  "ftp://ftp.cmegroup.com/SBEFix/Production/Templates/templates_FixBinary.xml"
   Schema definition file should be updated once every sunday before market open
   This file contains the various message types and a unique Id corresponding to each called the template id . Also the file has a unique id called the schema id. The message must be decoded based on
   information provided in the template.

2) Channel Configuration: Again channel configuration XML file. Get it here:
   For Production: curl -O "ftp://ftp.cmegroup.com/SBEFix/Production/Configuration/config.xml"
   This file is updated daily. So its good to keep it upto date. This is the same file we have in mts/etc/cme.channels.prod.xml


3) Security Definition file: Get it here: This is a gzip compressed file containing 35=d (security definition FIX messages). This file is not refreshed intra-day and really you should be listening to the incremental feed or the insrtument definition feed for 
intra-day updats to security definitions. Get it here:
   wget  "ftp://ftp.cmegroup.com/SBEFix/Production/secdef.dat.gz"

4) Market schedule file: Again a file containing FIX messages (35=BJ, trading session list) containing timing information. Get the FIX description and the timimg file here:
   curl -O "ftp://ftp.cmegroup.com/SBEFix/Production/TradingSessionList.pdf"
   curl -O "ftp://ftp.cmegroup.com/SBEFix/Production/TradingSessionList.dat"
