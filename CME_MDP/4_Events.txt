Market events are mostly triggered by

1) Order Entry
2) Market state

1) Order Entry
   A single order acceptance can result in a book update message.
   An matching event (when an incoming order is macthed to resting orders in the book) can result in
   a) a trade message followed by a
   b) volume updates (if any)
   c) book update (if any), followed by
   d) statistical updates (if any, like change in high and lows etc).
   A trade can also result in triggering other stop orders which can generate a sequence of messages.

2) Market state events: Eg a scheduled close of market will result in a "MarketSecurityStatus" message (35=f) followed by book updates containing day order eliminations.

Mostly you'll see only 35=X on the incremental feed.

Important tags are:

60 - Nanotimestamp when the exchange processed the event. Multiple messages for the same event will have the same nanotimestamp.
269 - MDEntryType - the event that triggered this message, could be:
   *) Order Entry
   *) Matching event
   *) State change
   *) Security definition
   *) Daily Statistics

268 - NoMDEntries - Number of detailed messages (containing order information) for trades at each different price.
      So if there is a single matching event, containing orders that matched at price 100 and at 100.05, then
    268=2 and there will be two detailed messages one for TradeSummary@100 and one for TradeSummary@100.05268 - NoMDEntries - Number of detailed messages (containing order information) for trades at each different price.
          So if there is a single matching event, containing orders that matched at price 100 and at 100.05.

5799 - MatchEventIndicator - Each message will have this tag indicating if this is the last message for this event or are there more to follow.
       This can be there even in messages where 268=0 (ie no data). Typically
       5799=00000000 if not the last message and
       5799=10000000 if the last message

It is possible that sometimes a Market state change can happen during an event being handled.
In that case CME can send out 35=f with 5799=00000000 ie. there are more messages to  follow in the event.

Also CME provides a way to correlate every market data message which correlates do a given order entry.
