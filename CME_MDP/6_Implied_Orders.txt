CME in a bid to provide liquidity and quantity, can match outright orders with calendar-spread orders in the spread market.
When a futures order is matched to a spread order it is said to be an implied order.
See: http://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Implied+Orders
for more details. Its not very difficult though.
