With C# 2008, you can now declare a variable without specifying its type. The compiler will automatically deduse the type for you.
Eg:
	var x = 5;
The compiler automatically deduces that x is an integer.

Before C# 2008, this is how you declared a property.

private int _myItem;
public int MyItem
{
	get {
		return myItem
	}
	set {
		myItem = value;
	}
}

But now it is much easier, just say 

public int MyProperty { get; set; }
Using this syntax will produce the same results as the lengthy example

C# 2008 now allows you to assign values to an object ’ s properties at the moment the property is initialized. For instance,
suppose you have the following object in your code:

public class MyStructure
{
	public int MyProperty1 { get; set; }
	public int MyProperty2 { get; set; }
}

Using C# 2008, you can instantiate the MyStructure object as follows:

MyStructure myStructure = new MyStructure() { MyProperty1 = 5, MyProperty2 = 10 };

This same capability allows you to declare many items of a collection at once:

List<int> myInts = new List<int>() { 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 };

In this case, all the numbers are added to the myInts object as if you used the Add() method.
