You have seen how to compile console applications using csc.exe , but what about other types of
applications? What if you want to reference a class library? The full set of compilation options for the C#
compiler is of course detailed in the MSDN documentation, but we list here the most important options.
To answer the first question, you can specify what type of file you want to create using the /target
switch, often abbreviated to /t . This can be one of those shown in the following table.
Option Output

/t:exe A console application (the default)
/t:library A class library with a manifest
/t:module A component without a manifest
/t:winexe A Windows application (without a console window)
