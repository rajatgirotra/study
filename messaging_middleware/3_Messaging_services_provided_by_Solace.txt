4) Low latency
5) IPC shared memory

1) Reliable (also called Direct Messaging by Solace): 
Solace provides reliable (best-effort, must be TCP based) delivery of messages at low latency.

2) Guaranteed: Solace uses patented approach of queuing messages in high-speed on board memory instead of disks to offer
   persistence messaging with order's of magnitude much higher than software based solutions. For guaranteed messaging,
   the hardware Solace appliance must be equipped with an ADB (Assured Delivery Blade).
   
3) JMS based: Provides JMS broker based messaging

4) Low latency: Solace provides low latency of about 20 microseconds, with consistency that software can't touch.

5) IPC shared memory: 
When you are running multiple applications on the same server, Solace's IPC shared memory based messaging offers average
latency under 400 nanoseconds.
