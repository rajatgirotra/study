The aim of any messaging middleware is:

1) Sharing of information (data)

Typically large distributed applications can have unprecedented volumes of data. A messaging middleware
should provide RELIABLE sharing of data between applications, devices and people located locally or globally.

Today's corporations and decision makers demand complete upto the second information. For this you'll need to collect
data from increasing number and variety of sources; and distribute to a set of applications.

So basically a messaging middleware needs to provide a strong infrastructure for real time data movement; which is essentially
the key to capitalise on the trends that you see in the market. Using this real time information decision makers can do
real time analytics.

Other aims:
1) Obviously high throughput
2) Low latency
3) Failure mechanisms (Auto or manual) - This helps make your applications fault tolerant and also
prepare your application for disaster recovery.

All the above will help you achieve robust distributed applications.
