Next you can read the Solace documentation solace\Solace_Platform_HTML_Documentation_R70\index.html

For now I have just given a cursory look to:

1) what Direct and Guaranteed messaging is
2) What are topics, queues, destinations, endpoints etc etc.
3) Message VPN, Message VPN bridge
4) Message formats, Headers and Data, How messaging and persistence works etc.
I'll slowly return to these topics at a later point, as i start understanding the API.

So I am going to delve into the developer guide straightway. 
You can also refer the C API here: solace/Solace_Platform_HTML_Documentation_R70/API__Developer_Online_Reference_Documentation/c/index.html
