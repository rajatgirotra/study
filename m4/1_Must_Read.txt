m4 is a macro language. This means that you can define macros like

define(AUTHOR, William Shakespeare)
and then you can specify some text or file as input to m4. m4 will then replace or substitue occurrences of "AUTHOR" with "William Shakespeare"

We'll study other things as we go along

define() above is really a builtin macro, also called an m4 builtin. You can define the macro along with the text that is input to m4. A macro() by itself evaulates to an empty string, so nothing is output, however a new line is ouput after the macro() definition is read.

Eg: m4 1.macro

will output
<new_line>
Hamlet was written by W.Shakespeare<new_line>

To not output new line, write "dnl" after defining the macro. See 2.macro
some_macro()dnl  --> meaning delete new line
