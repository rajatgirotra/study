# lets define a simple macro plus
define(`plus',`+')
plus

# Now how do you output ++ together
plusplus doesnt work

# So you can do this trick
plus()plus
# the plus takes an empty set of args which are swallowed by m4.

# But another problem
define(`oper', `plus')
oper()oper
# this becomes plusoper and gets printed as such.
# so the workaround is to add an empty quote which servers as a token boundary
oper`'oper
# will mean plus`'oper --> +`'oper --> +`'plus --> +`'+ --> ++
