We will follow the google code labs "tensorflow-with-poets" tutorial to train a classifier. Remember we will not be training
our classifier from scratch. We will retrain (also called transfer learning) our classifier on top of Inception.

Inception
---------
Inception is one of google's best image classifiers which has gone through deep learning of over 1.2 million images
across 1000 categories. So there is already a lot of parameters that Inception is aware of. Deep learning can take time-
upto weeks or months depending on the size of your training data. So in this tutorial, we just adjust inception by feeding
it our training data of flowers images. So it saves us a lot of time of training our classifier from scratch and we leverage
what Inception has already learnt. The Deep Learning Neural Network has many layers as you'll see later, so here we are
training the final layer of the network, so it should be much quicker and will save us a lot of time.

MobileNet
--------
Just like Inception, we have another model called MobileNet. The difference is that Inception is optimized for accuracy
and mobilenet is optimized for space (in the form of training data images) and speed, at the cost of some accuracy.

How to retrain now
-------------------
Assuming you have tensorflow installed and you are following the poets tutorial. You should have downloaded the image
training data already. To retrain using Mobilenet, see 12_retrain.sh
