Other important options in the retrain script can be seen by running it with -h

python3 -m scripts.retrain -h

For example, the --learning_rate parameter controls the magnitude of the updates to the final layer during training.
So far we have left it out, so the program has used the default learning_rate value of 0.01. If you specify a small
learning_rate, like 0.005, the training will take longer, but the overall precision might increase. Higher values of
learning_rate, like 1.0, could train faster, but typically reduces precision, or even makes training unstable.

It's the --summaries_dir option that controls the name in tensorboard. Earlier we used 12_retrain_mobilenet.sh
TensorBoard is monitoring the contents of the training_summaries directory, so setting --summarys_dir to training_summaries or any subdirectory of training_summaries will work.

You may want to set the following two options together, so your results are clearly labeled:
--learning_rate=0.5
--summaries_dir=training_summaries/LR_0.5

Training your own category
--------------------------
In this example, we trained flowers category. You can now use the same example to train any category of your choice using
inception, mobilenet etc as base models. Download as much data(images) for your category, like Cars, Fruits etc and pass
it as the --image-dir parameter of the script you ran in 12_retrain_mobilenet.sh, to retrain just the last layer.
Make sure you collect as many pictures of each label you want to be predicted.
