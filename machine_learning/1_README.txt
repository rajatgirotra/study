Machine learning (ML) is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. Earlier AI programs do one thing and they excel at that one thing only. Today we want to write one program that can solve many problems without needing to be written. An example would be "AlphaGo". Its an AI game which is competing in the world "Go" championship but it is also learning to play "tile" games. 

ML is the study of algorithms that learn from examples and experience instead of relying on hard coded rules.
For example, I give you the image of a Fruit and i tell you to identify which fruit it is. For this you will need to use some form of image processing and lay down a set of rules like
1) How many orange pixels does it have? (it could be an orange).
2) What shape is it?? (round, flat, curved etc)

Now, this might sound like a simple example, but the real world is a lot messier. No matter how hard you try, there will always be a shape/image that you cannot tell. Or how do you handle the case when the image is black and white?? or when the image is not a Fruit at all. Then you have to write more rules and some of your rules also start to break. No matter how so many rules you write, there will always be an image so that your rules can find the fruit. So instead of writing rules, we need to figure out an algorithm which can create the rules for us, instead of us writing it by hand.
