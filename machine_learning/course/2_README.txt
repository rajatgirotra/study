You already know you need training and testing data for Machine Learning. But what guarantees your data is good. 
You actually need a data preprocessing step to make sure your data is good otherwise your machine learning results might not be accurate.

Let's see how to do data preprocessing. But first lets get some data.

Scikit-learn is based on decorator pattern. Just remember this. This will help you understand the api's in the next chapters.
