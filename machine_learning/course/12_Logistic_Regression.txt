Logistic Regression Intuition
-----------------------------

Lets say you have a 2D scatter plot of people ages (on the x axis) and whether they purchased a religious holiday trip (on the y axis). The scatter plot clearly shows that young people do not take the trip and old people take the trip. So the y-axis has just two points (0 or 1) i.e Yes/No

But what if you want to answer the question from a probablistic point of view? i.e given an age, what is the likelyhood that he/she will take the trip. How do you achieve that?

If we draw a trend line, ofcourse it will not be a good fit. Let's say the trend line crosses the x-axis at 35 years and again at 85 years. This means that

1) below 35 yrs, ppl dont take the trip
2) above 85 yrs, ppl always take the trip
3) between 35 and 85 yrs, you can establish a probability of someone taking a trip.

Since the y-axis has two points 0 and 1, and since probability values are also between 0 and 1, we can convert the trend line into a probablistic equation using sigmoid function. See your orange register for more details.
