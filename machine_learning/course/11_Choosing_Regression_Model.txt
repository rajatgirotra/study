To select which regression model is best, try out all and see which one is best by looking at the Adj R-Squared for every model

The regression models you have studied are:

1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Linear Regression
4. Support Vector Regression
5. Decision Tree Regression
6. Random Forest Regression

from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

For all of the Regression models, we will learn about their tuning later. Tuning is modifying the hyper parameters of these models.
