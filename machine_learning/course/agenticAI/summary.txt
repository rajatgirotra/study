I am Rajat Girotra, a computer science engineer from Amity School of Engg. and Technology from the class of 2005. I live in Singapore with my wife and 2 kids.
I love to maintain discipline in my life. I prefer to wake up early and sleep early. I love to code. I am a family man and like to spend most of my time
with my family and children or otherwise coding in C++ and python.
