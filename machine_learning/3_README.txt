You already know what supervised learning is:
1) Collect data sets. The more the training data you have, the better your classifier will predict the fruit.
2) Feed the data sets to your classifier
3) The classifier will make predictions based on the data set.

Think of the data-set as a spreadsheet in which you have multiple columns. The columns which describe something about the prediction we want to make are called features. And then there is one column which actually is the label. So in a dataset, we have
1) Features
2) Label
