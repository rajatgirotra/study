Set Test Variable  --> Will set a variable only in the scope of the currently executing test case. If one keyword sets a test variable, it will be available in all subsequent keywords of the same test case.

Set Suite Variable --> Will set a variable only in the scope of the current suite. Other suites (including any child suites) will not see this variable. Similar to setting a variable in the current test data file in the variables table or importing a Variable file in the current test data file.

Set Global Variable --> Will set a variable which will be available everywhere. Similar to setting a variable using the -v name:value command line option. These three keywords do not return anything

Return From Keyword ${arg} --> dynamically return from keyword. All next instructions in the keyword will be skipped
Return From Keyword If ${condition} ${arg} --> dynamically return from keyword. All next instructions in the keyword will be skipped

Set Library Search Order @LibraryOrResourceList --> robot will search the keywords in the libraries defined in this list instead of using the default priority location.
The search order is valid only in the suite where this keywords is used; so this keyword can be used at Suite Level.
Keywords in resources always have higher priority than keywords in libraries regardless the search order.
The old order is returned and can be used to reset the search order later.
Library and resource names in the search order are both case and space insensitive.
