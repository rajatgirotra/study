robotframework is a ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development) framework. You write tests using keywords.
Keywords are part of libraries. robotframework ships with a set of its own keyword libraries which define multiple keywords for doing common tasks. Some of the common library names are:

1) Builtin
2) OperatingSystem
3) Collections
4) String
5) Process
6) DateTime

etc etc.

You can also have user defined libraries where you can define your own keywords.

Keywords
========
Keywords are nothing but plain english expressions that describe what that expression does. Keywords can take one or more arguments and also return values. Behind the scenes, keywords are actually bound to function calls. You can also combine keywords to create higher level keywords.

Tools
=====

robotframework also has a set of tools used for different purposes. like:
1) Tidy: Tool used to cleanup and convert a robot framework test file into multiple supported formats.
2) libdoc: tool for generating keyword documentation
3) testdoc: tool for generating high level HTML documentation of the test cases.
4) rebot: generating various logs and report.
