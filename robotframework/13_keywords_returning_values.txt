*** Test Cases ***
Assign Multiple
    ${a}    ${b}    ${c} =    Get Three
    ${first}    @{rest} =    Get Three
    @{before}    ${last} =    Get Three
    ${begin}    @{middle}    ${end} =    Get Three
Assuming that the keyword Get Three returns a list [1, 2, 3], the following variables are created:

${a}, ${b} and ${c} with values 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
${first} with value 1, and @{rest} with value [2, 3].
@{before} with value [1, 2] and ${last} with value 3.
${begin} with value 1, @{middle} with value [2] and ${end} with value 3.


Keywords can return a scalar value, a list, a dictionary or any other python object. Example:

*** Test Cases ***
Example
    &{dict} =    Create Dictionary    first=1    second=${2}    ${3}=third
    Length Should Be    ${dict}    3
    Do Something    &{dict}
    Log    ${dict.first}

Create dictionary returns a dictionary here.
