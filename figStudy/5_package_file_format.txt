A fig package file (package.fig) has the following format

1) Start with the fig grammer version (v0, v1 or v2)
2) Next is the asset information (archive and resource tags)
3) Next are retrieve tags
4) Next you can specify  n number of configs - Each config can have "set, append, add, include, include-file and command" tags

Eg:

grammar v1

archive path/somefile.tar.gz
resource foo/*.jar

retrieve LOCATION_VARIABLE->"some relative directory path/[package]"

config default
    set VARIABLE=value
    add CLASSPATH='foo.jar'

    include dependency/1.2.3
    override indirect-dependency/4.5.6

    command
        echo 'Hello,' "world!"
    end
end



Instead of creating a package definition file, you can also create package description from command line
using --set, --add, --archive, --resource, --include, --override switches
This creates an in memory image of the package file.

Try the following command.

fig --publish-local myFirstPackage/1.0.0:default --set TOAST=bar 

When testing your package creation, always publish your package locally using --publish-locally instead of --publish
Only when you are done testing and you have a final version, should you publish using --publish

Also, it is best to use --update-if-missing (-m) option to update the package locally from the repository,
as it will only download stuff if needed. If you use --update, fig will always download stuff irrespective if the local copy
is out of date or not.
