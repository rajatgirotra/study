Note the following is global fig config explanation; not config explanation in package.fig files.
Both are very different.

Fig can be figured using three config files in order:

1) command line specified config file using --figrc option
2) ~/.figrc file
3) _meta/figrc file in the remote repository.

All config files are JSON format with only one JSON dictionary specifying all JSON objects.

Options in 1) override those in 2) and those in 2) override those in 3).

Some config options are:

"default FIG_REMOTE_URL"
"log configuration" - Path to Log4r (Log for ruby configuration file)
"suppress warnings" - An array of string of warning messages to be turned off.
"url whitelist" - An array of URL to allow for asset statements.
"environment variables to include in comments in published packages" - An array of strings of variables to include as comments at the top
of published package files.
