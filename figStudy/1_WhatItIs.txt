Fig is an application for managing/configuring your work environment and manage dependencies across a team of developers.
https://github.com/mfoemmel/fig

in Fig you have a remote server where you store package files (package.fig or application.fig) along with metadata information and other depedencies
of your project.

this files are then downloaded into the local repository on the developer machine based on FIG_HOME environment variables (default
location is ~/.fighome)

Other FIG related environment variables:

1) FIG_REMOTE_URL: address of remote repository: example: ftp://devnas/Builds/Fig/repos
2) FIG_HOME: the default location where package files and dependencies are downloaded. Default is ~/.fighome
3) FIG_USERNAME and FIG_PASSWORD : Username and password used for ftping to download packages.
   By Default fig uses anonymous FTP. If you need authentication, use the --login option; in which you'll need the variables
   defined above.
4) FIG_FTP_THREADS : Number of threads to use during FTP. Default is 16
5) SHELL : When fig runs an external command it uses the value of shell as the external shell to use
6) FIG_SVN_EXECUTABLE or FIG_GIT_EXECUTABLE: typically not needed to be set. Only set if svn/git you want to use is not in path.

Each package is identified by a "Package Descriptor". A package descriptor is just a way to identify a package and has 
a standard  naming convention.

Package Descriptor : package_name/version_number:config_name
Only alphanumerics, underscore, hyphens, period are allowed: Following pkg descriptors are valid.

package --> package with no version and "default" config
package/version

package/version:config
:config  --> used inside a package definition file to refer to other config in the same file.
