It was multiple business verticals.

The question really should have been why dont you want to join Bloomberg which has a simple answer that there is no reason.
Everyone knows its the leader company in whatever they do, whether it developing cutting edge software, or providing market data,
or analytics; which is only  possible if you have brilliant people onboard, and working closely with each other with a clear mind
set of what they are doing.. So obviously I will be delighted to work with a team like that.
