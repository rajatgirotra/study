protoc compiler is slightly wierd in the sense where it generates the cpp outfiles.
For example: i have the following heirarchy

proto_files
   - a.proto
   - b.proto
   - some_folder
        - c.proto
        - d.proto

Now you invoke protoc like this

protoc -I <some_path_1> -I <some_path_2> --cpp_out <output_path> xxx.proto

Now -I/--proto-path is the same option. You can use either one of them. These are used to tell protobuf where to find imported protobuf files.

If I run

1) protoc -I proto_files --cpp_out $HOME c.proto  
   a) Protoc will first check that there should be atleast one -I option which should be a prefix of the absolute path of c.proto; otherwise it will give you an error.
   b) If multiple such -I paths are found, it will use the shortest path and create the cpp files in 
      $HOME/<abosulte_prefix - shortest_prefix_matched>/ folder

   So in this case my cpp files should be in $HOME/some_folder/
