RStudio is an open source UI which makes working with R very easy. Consider using it.
I installed RStudio 1.1.383 which required R3.0.1 or greater.

It will download a deb file which you can install.

sudo apt-get install libjpeg2
sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/rstudio.deb

Run "rstudio" from terminal to start rstudio.
rstudio brings up an integrated environment, where you can create R scripts, run R functions, view plots, install packages, run terminal commands all from one UI. Good tool yo use.
