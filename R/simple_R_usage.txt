R commands are case sensitive.

R stores commands you execute in the editor in a file called .Rhistory. This file is used by R to run previously executed commands using up and down arrows

If you have R commands in a text file called test.R, you can execute all commands together using

> source("test.R")

> sink("abc.out") --> will redirect all output from console to abc.out file
> sink() --> will redirect all output to console once again.

In R, you create and manipulate objects. Objects could be
1) variables
2) arrays of numbers
3) functions
4) character strings
and other things

> objects() or ls() command will list all objects in the current R session/workspace.
> rm(x, y, z, ink) command is used to remove objects from the current R workspace.

When exiting R, it gives an option to store the current workspace. If you choose Yes, all objects are serialized and stored in a file called .Rdata in the current working directory. These objects can be used again later in a new session.
