You can get help in R at multiple levels.

1) Function level help.
Let say you know which function to use but dont know how? Use function level help for that case

help("solve") --> will show help on "solve" function
?solve is the shortform
help.start() will bring up help in the browser. Best way to browse help
??solve will give you more ways of searching help for a function or feature
help("[[") --> to get help on the double bracket feature


2) Package level help. Just click on the package name in Rstudio will bring up help on that package.
You can search more in that help section. Some packages have very good documentation/tutorials called vignetts. These are like Gold and you must explore them.

3) CRAN Task Views: If you are new to R and want to explore what R can offer you for tasks like
NLP, machine learning, statistics, Finance, etc. Go to CRAN Task views in google. It tells you all the packages available for your tasks and you can choose whichever you want.

4) Finally use StackOverflow for online community help.

R is an open source, high level, modular programming language. High level means a number of modules are pre-built with functions and object classes which you can use straight out of the box.
