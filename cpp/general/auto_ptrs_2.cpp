Here, the output of the program is as follows:

after initialization:
p: 42
q: 0
r: NULL
after assigning values:
p: -77
q: 42
r: NULL

This example defines an output operator for auto_ptrs. To do this, it passes an auto_ptr as a constant reference. According to the discussion on page 43, you should usually not pass an auto_ptr in any form. This function is an exception to this rule. Note that the assignment

 *r = *p;

 is an error. It dereferences an auto_ptr that refers to no object. According to the standard, this results in undefined behavior; for example, a crash. As you can see, you can manipulate the objects to which constant auto_ptrs refer, but you can't change which objects they own. Even if r was nonconstant, the last statement would not be possible because it would change the constant p.
