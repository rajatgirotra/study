Initialization of Constant Static Members

It is now possible to initialize integral constant static members inside the class structure. This is
useful when the constant is used in the class structure after the initialization. For example:

class MyClass {
static const int num = 100;
int elems[num];
...
};

Note that you still have to to define space for a constant static member that is initialized within a class definition:

const int MyClass::num; // no initialization here
