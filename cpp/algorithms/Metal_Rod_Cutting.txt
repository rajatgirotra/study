You are given a metal rod of some length n.
Separately you are given prices of metal rods of length less than equal to n.
Eg: 

Length: 1		2		3		4		5		6		7		8
Price:	1		5		8		9		10		17		17		20

You have to cut the given rod into smaller pieces, so as to maximise the profit.
For eg:for n = 8, you will cut into length of 2 and 6 for  max profit of 22.

Solution:
Start from the beginning

for length 1: max profit is price[0]
for length 2: max profit is max(price[1], price[1]+price[1])
for length 3: max profit is max(price[2], price[1]+price[2])
for length 4: max profit is max(price[3], price[0]+price[2], price[1]+price[1])

So for each rod length n, you look at max profits of earlier lengths.
Solution will be O(n*n)
