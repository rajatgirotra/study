Print missing elements that lie in range 0 â€“ 99
Given an array of integers print the missing elements that lie in range 0-99. If there are more than one missing, collate them, otherwise just print the number.
Note that the input array may not be sorted and may contain numbers outside the range [0-99], but only this range is to be considered for printing missing elements.

Examples

     Input: {88, 105, 3, 2, 200, 0, 10}
     Output: 1
             4-9
             11-87
             89-99


     Input: {9, 6, 900, 850, 5, 90, 100, 99}
     Output: 0-4
             7-8
             10-89
             91-98
			 
Solution: Create a boolean arr[0..99] Initially all false
Traverse the input array and mark arr[input[i]] = true where 0 <= i <= 99
Then just traverse arr[] and print results.
