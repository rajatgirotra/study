Given an array A[] and a number x, check for pair in A[] with sum as x
Solution:
--------
1) Sort first : O(nlgn)
2) Then use to variables to travese together from starting and from last
Loop while l < r.
       (a) If (A[l] + A[r] == sum)  then return 1
       (b) Else if( A[l] + A[r] <  sum )  then l++
       (c) Else r--    
4) No candidates in whole array - return 0





Variation: The sorted array is now rotated at some arbitrary point
Examples:
Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10}, x = 16
Output: true
There is a pair (6, 10) with sum 16

Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, x = 35
Output: true
There is a pair (26, 9) with sum 35

Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, x = 45
Output: false
There is no pair with sum 45.

1) Solution: travese first to find the largest element, the element after that is the minimum.
Again traverse from minimum to largest
