Although you can overload almost all the operators available in C, the use of operator overloading is fairly restrictive. In particular, you cannot combine operators that currently have no meaning in C (such as ** to represent exponentiation), you cannot change the evaluation precedence of operators, and you cannot change the number of arguments required by an operator. This makes sense . all of these actions would produce operators that confuse meaning rather than clarify it.
