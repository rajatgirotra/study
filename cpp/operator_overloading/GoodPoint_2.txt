Operator "=" is only allowed to be a member function.
This is because if the user does not specify a nonstatic "=" member function, then the compiler will synthesize one for the class.
In that case the = member function and the friend function become ambiguous.

The subscript, operator[ ], must be a member function and it requires a single
argument. Because operator[ ] implies that the object it.s being called for
acts like an array, you will often return a reference from this operator, so
it can be conveniently used on the left-hand side of an equal sign

The operators new and delete control dynamic storage allocation and can be
overloaded in a number of different ways.
