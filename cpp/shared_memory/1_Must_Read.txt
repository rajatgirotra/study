Refer to the excellent book Linux programming interface i have downloaded
and also to a PDF on Linux IPC mechanisms.

We have two API's for shared memory on Unix. SysV and POSIX.
SysV is old and less in use now, POSIX is much heavily used lately.

We'll start with learning POSIX API first.
Before you go ahead, you must first understand in a high level

1) mmap() system call to share memory between related processes
2) mmap() system call to share memory between unrelated processes (backed by file on traditional file system)
