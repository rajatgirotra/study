/* 

This example is much shorter, since most of the code in the original example was just the overhead for checking the casts. The target type of a dynamic_cast is placed in angle brackets, like the other new-style C++ casts (static_cast, and so on), and the object to cast appears as the operand. dynamic_cast requires that the types you use it with be polymorphic if you want safe downcasts.[118] This in turn requires that the class must have at least one virtual function. Fortunately, the Security base class has a virtual destructor, so we didnt have to invent an extra function to get the job done. Because dynamic_cast does its work at runtime, using the virtual table, it tends to be more expensive than the other new-style casts.
