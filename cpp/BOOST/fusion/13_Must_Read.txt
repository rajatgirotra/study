Sequence comparisons..

Boost Fusion provides a number of comparison operators. I am not going to write code for all of these but are failrly straight-forward

typedef boost::fusion::vector<> v1();
typedef boost::fusion::vector<> v2();

v1 == v2; // will compare each element one by one.
v1 != v2;
v1 < v2; v1 <= v2;
v1 > v2; v1 >= v2;
