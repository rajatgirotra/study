fusion is divided into many layers of modules. There are folders in boost/fusion/ corresponding to each module.
Some modules are:

algorithm - Which provides headers for fusion algo's
container - Which provide vector, list, dequeue, map, set etc.
sequence - which provide comparison, intrinsics and io
support - which provides some support functions like is_sequence, is_view, tag_of, category_of etc.
iterator - Which provides iterator functions for sequences and containers
adapted - functions and classes to adapt array, boost::tuple, mpl, std::pair, std::tuple etc to boost fusion
tuple
views - which provides views like filter_view, flatten_view, joint_view etc etc. You'll learn about them soon.

and some more views.
