A metafunction is nothing but a class or class template that represents a function, invocable at compile time.
A meta function will always have a nested ::type typename member. All template parameters are nothing but types.

All the functions in 9.cpp if you see are meta-functions.

A nullary meta function is a function which is invokable without any actual template parameters required.

Eg:

 struct always_int {
     typedef int type;
 };
