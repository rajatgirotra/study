It turns out that you can create new classes derived from io_service::service

class my_service : public io_service::service
{
public:
   //Must declare this member
   static ios_service::id id;

   //c'tor
   explicit my_service(io_service& ios);

private:
   //Must destroy all user handlers objects help by this service.
   virtual void shutdown_service();
};

Then io_service provides friend function to

1) add these service objects to io_service
2) use these service objects
3) check if a io_service object has a specified service,

We'll see later how this is used.
