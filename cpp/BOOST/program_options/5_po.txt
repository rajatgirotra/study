Ok, in program_options we have,

typedef basic_command_line_parser<char> command_line_parser;
typedef basic_command_line_parser<wchar_t> wcommand_line_parser;

the class has the following functions:

options(options_descriptions) // Sets the options_descriptions object to use.

positional(positional_objects_descriptions) // Sets the positional_options_descriptions to use.

style(int) - sets the style to use. You'll see this later

extra_parser(ext_parser) - Used to define a custom parser for the command line. will come to this in the next example.

run() - Start parsing the command line. Can throw an exception.

allow_unregistered() - Instead of throwing an exception for unrecognized options, it creates an object of type
		       basic_option<charT> and sets the unrecognized field to true. Later yo can collect these options using the
		       collect_unrecognized() function.

extra_style_parser(style_parser); - At the moment I dont know what this does.
