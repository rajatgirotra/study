The library has three main components:

The options description component, which describes the allowed options and what to do with the values of the options.

The parsers component, which uses this information to find option names and values in the input sources and return them.

The storage component, which provides the interface to access the value of an option. It also converts the string representation of values that parsers return into desired C++ types.

To be a little more concrete, the options_description class is from the options description component, the parse_command_line function is from the parsers component, and the variables_map class is from the storage component.

For that outside world, the storage component is the most important. It provides a class which stores all option values and that class can be freely passed around your program to modules which need access to the options.
All the other components can be used only in the place where the actual parsing is the done.
