To use boost.regex you must link your program with the boost.regex library (libboost_regex.a or libboost_regex.so)

boost::regex library provides a main template class boost_regex

template<some template paramaters>
class boost_regex {
	//c'tor
        boost_regex(const char* p, //pattern to be searched for
			flag_type f = regex_constants::normal); //any flag, just as ignore case, etc etc.

        //bool isEmpty(); //returns true if the pattern is an empty string.

       //unsigned mark_count(); //returns the number of subexpressions in the pattern.ie. expressions within parenthesis.
				//Remember unix sed Tagged Regular Expression feature.

      flag_type flags() const; //returns a BITMASK containing the option flags that are set for this regular expression.
}; 

typedef boost_regex<char> regex;
typedef boost_regex<wchar_t> wregex;

Then you have three powerful functions.

1] regex_match() - returns true only if the entire input sequence matches the pattern.
2] regex_search() - returns true if the pattern is found anywhere in the input sequence.
3] regex_replace() - replaces the pattern found with the user defined format string.

All these are template functions and there are many overloaded versions of these functions.
See Boost documentation online to see the exact definitions.
