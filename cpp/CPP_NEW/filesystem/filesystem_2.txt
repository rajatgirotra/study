The Path object is really trivial. you can construct it with strings. Path object has

1) root-name (example C: on windows, empty for linux)
2) root-directory (distinguishes relative path from the absolute path)
3) relative-path (could be a filename, directory separator or a relative-path).

We will see example shortly.
