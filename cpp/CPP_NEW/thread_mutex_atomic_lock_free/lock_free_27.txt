The HARD TRUTH ABOUT VOLATILE

The volatile keyword in C++ is almost useless in multi-threading code.
You will almost never need it.

Why?

1) It disables compiler desired compiler optimizations to speed up your programs. So your programs get slower.
   Because it will cause volatile data to be read from actual memory instead of from internal registers.

2) It does not guarantee atomicity of reads and writes.

3) Ordinary reads can move in either direction across a volatile read-write.
   Ordinary writes can also move in either direction across a volatile read-write.
   Only reads/writes of volatile variables cannot be re-ordered.
