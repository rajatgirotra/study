Atomicity

What is it??
A MEMORY OPERATION is said to be atomic if it completes in one step relative to other threads.
When you perform an atomic store, no other thread can read its value half-complete.

When can memory operations be non-atomic?? There are multiple reasons:
1) Because the memory operation uses multiple CPU instructions.
2) Because sometimes a single CPU instructions can be non-atomic.
3) Non-atomic simple because you think it is atomic.

If you access an atomic variable using a non-atomic operation, you'll have a data race and undefined behavior.
Worse you can have torn reads or torn writes (ie half reads and half writes)

In C and C++, every operation is presumed non-atomic unless otherwise specified by the compiler or hardware vendor
EVEN PLAIN 32-BIT INTEGER ASSIGNMENT (like i = 10).

The language standards have nothing to say about atomicity in this case. Maybe INTEGER ASSIGNMENT IS ATOMIC, MAYBE IT ISN'T.
Since non-atomic operations don't make any guarantees, plain integer assignment in C is non-atomic by definition.

In practice, we usually know more about our target platforms than that. For example, IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT ON ALL MODERN
X86, X64, ITANIUM, sparc, arm AND pOWERpc PROCESSORS, PLAIN 32-BIT INTEGER ASSIGNMENT IS ATOMIC AS LONG AS THE TARGET VARIABLE IS NATURALLY ALIGNED.
ie all LOADS AND STORES OF INTEGERS ARE ATOMIC AS LONG AS THEY ARE NATURALLY ALIGNED.

ie i = 10 is atomic if i is aligned on a double word boundary.

In C++11, you can use atomic loads and stores using the C++11 atomic library.

A shared resource like a simple boolean or integer, or a complex struct must always be atomic so that reads and writes are always atomic.

AS A RULE OF THUMB, every shared resource should be atomic in lock-free programming.
If you are using locks, it does not really matter, as it will be protected by the lock.
