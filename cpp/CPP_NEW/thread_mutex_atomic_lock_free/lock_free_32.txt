A strong hardware memory model is one in which every machine instruction comes implicitly with acquire and release semantics.
As a result, when one CPU core performs a sequence of writes, every other CPU core sees those values change in the same order that they were written.

It's not too hard to visualize. Just imagine a refinement of the source control analogy where all modifications are committed to
shared memory in-order (no StoreStore reordering), pulled from shared memory in-order (no LoadLoad reordering),
and instructions are always executed in-order (no LoadStore reordering). StoreLoad reordering, however, still remains possible.

Why?? u ask is StoreLoad still possible.
Because CPU is always faster than memory. So it actually buffers all its write and therefore can read ahead of a load.
So a StoreLoad re-ordering is possible.

In a sequentially consistent memory model, there is no memory reordering. It's as if the entire program execution is reduced to a
sequential interleaving of instructions from each thread. In particular, the result r1 = r2 = 0 you saw before is not possible.

Also remember locks are not slow. Lock contention is slow.

When you get more time, do read 15/16/17.cpp and poisson.cpp
