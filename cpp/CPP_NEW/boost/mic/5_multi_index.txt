In
//define a MIC now.
typedef boost::multi_index_container < Employee,
            indexed_by <
                //NO TAG
                ordered_unique < identity < Employee >, std::greater<std::string> >,
                //WITH TAG
                ordered_non_unique < tag<by_name>, member < Employee, std::string, &Employee::name > >,
                //WITH TAG
                sequenced < tag < by_sequence> >
            >
        > EmployeeSet;

the general format of ordered_unique index is

[ Tag, Key Extractor, Comparison Predicate ]

The Key extractor tells how the sorting will be performed and on which field(s). For example, in the EmployeeSet MIC, we have two indexes.

1] in the first index, we have identity<Employee> which basically returns the Employee object which serves as the key.
2] in the second index, we have member<Employee, string, &Employee::name> which returns as key the member of  the
element specified.

Basically a key extractor is a function object where:
1] the return type is typedef'ed to result_type
2] the value returned is as specified by the creator of the MIC. So member<Employee, string, &Employee::name> returns:
struct implementation_defined_type {
    typedef string result_type;
    result_type operator() (const Employee& e) {
        return e.name; 
    }
};


Other extractors.

After "identity" and "member", you have

a) const_mem_fun <Class, Type, &Class::member_function>
    The member function of the class must be const since elements in a multi_index_container are treated as constant, much as elements of a std::set.
    It should also not take any arguments. So basically, MIC will call your const member function, and it should return a
    key based on which sorting will be performed.

b) You also have global_fun which must take as argument "const Element&", and return a key based on which sorting will
   be performed. Instead of a simple global function it could also be a static function of a class.

I'll show u examples in a while. Also, you have mem_fun available which does not require your class member function to be
const, but it's a bit tricky to use. We'll see that also later.

c) composite_key - This is a key extractor that can be used when you want to sort elements on more than one fields. Also,
composite_key extractor allows you to specify the sorting order (less than or greater than). 


d) The last one is the user defined key extractor. To create a user defined key extractor, you'll have to do two things.
One: Create a "result_type" typedef which will be the type of the key used for sorting.
Two: Create a function call operator() with one parameter, which will be of type "const Element&", using which you
return the key object.


So all in all you have the following key extractors

1) identity
2) member: ALWAYS USE BOOST_MULTI_INDEX_MEMBER macro which is portable. By default,
            BOOST_MULTI_INDEX_MEMBER(A, type, x) expands to
  member<A, type, &A::x> or member<A, type, offsetof(A, x)>. So use it always.

3) const_mem_fun: INSTEAD ALWAYS USE BOOST_MULTI_INDEX_CONST_MEM_FUN for Portable code.
4) global_fun
5) composite_key
6) user-defined extractor.


Also, each of the boost defined extractors are overloaded so that you can use different types of the same element:
For example, with the following key extractor.

struct name_extractor
{
  typedef std::string result_type;

  const result_type& operator()(const employee& e) const {return e.name;}
  const result_type& operator()(employee* e) const {return e->name;}
}; 

Your MIC can contain either "employee" or "employee*".
This way whenever you define a key extractor, you must define overloads, so you can use the plain object,
the object pointer or the object pointer wrapped in a smart pointer like boost::shared_ptr.

Next we'll use each of these key extractor in an example, where the container item will be

1] the plain object
2] the object pointer
3] a smart pointer.
