boost multi index container
===========================
Sometimes you want to have more than one lookup criteria on the same set of elements.
For example, lets say you have a list of employee ids and their names. You might need

1) To access the elements by their ID in ascending order.
2) To access the elements by their name in descending order.

To do this you can do the following:

1) Whenever you need a new access order, you create a copy of all the elements and then sort it in the required criteria.
OR
2) Keep them separately according to their sorted criteria. Whenever there is an update in one set, you update
(synchronize) the other sets. This always a lot of headache as you have to look after sync issues.

The way out is to use BOOST Multi Index Container. It allows you to have more than one indexes on the underlying set of
elements. Each index allows you to access the list according to a specified key. So this is ideal where more than one
sorting criteria are relevant.

namespace is boost::multi_index
