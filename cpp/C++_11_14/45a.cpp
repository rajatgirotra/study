// tuple in C++11
/*
Very simple concept. Just a generalization of the concept of pairs.
A tuple is a holder of elements of different types. Similar to C-like strcutues,
but instead of accessing elements by names, in tuple we access by their order.
like 0 for first element, 1 for second element and so on.

Although the concept is pretty simple, but it is not very straight-forward to
understand the API, so we'll take our time and go over each function in detail.
