The files generated by soapcpp2 contain a set of functions for each serializable type defined in the data binding interface generated by wsdl2h.
You really dont need to look into the details of the functions. Just concentrate on a few interface functions used to create, read, write, copy, serialize such objects. Lets do that now.

Please read hr.cpp next.
