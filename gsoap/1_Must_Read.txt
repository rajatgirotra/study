gSOAP is a C/C++ toolkit which provides support for XML Web services and XML data bindings for C/C++.
What you can do with gSOAP.
1) It provides support for XML schema validations (against XSD schemas)
2) You can provide it with an XSD schema and it can generate XML data bindings for C/C++.
   XML data binding means relating an XML type (simple type or complex type) to a C/C++ type. So for example, integers in XML are bound to integers in C++. Complex types will be bound to C structs or C++ classes. So it can generate these bindings for you. Once you have these bindings, you can quickly convert an XML to C++ (de-serialization) and C++ to XML (serialization).
3) It provides support for JSON also.
