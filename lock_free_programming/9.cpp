/*
 * We see that problem 2 gets solved as revcMessage() reads "ready" from memory on each iteration.
 * But problem 1 still remains.
 * 
 * The Standard says that reads and writes to volatile data cannot be re-ordered. This means if you have two or more volatile data.
 * Then their reads and writes should be in program order.
 *
 * But volatile data can be re-ordered across ordinary read-writes; as long as it does not change the observable behavior of an
 * abstract machine.
 * So problem 1 remains.
 *
 * To solve it we really need to change value also to volatile(10.cpp proves it). But let say value is a complex data structure, then do we keep
 * changing every field in the data structure to volatile. NO ??
 * Really what we need is a memory barrier. To make sure that changes to ready are visible only after value is updated.
 *
 * infact in problem 2 also, there is nothing which prevents the compiler from loading value before loading ready. So we should use
 * memory barrier there also, and get rid of volatile all together.
 *
 * Also ready should be made atomic.
