A crisis
Of course, any upcast loses type information about an object. If you say

Wind w;
Instrument* ip = &w;
the compiler can deal with ip only as an Instrument pointer and nothing else. That is, it cannot know that ip actually happens to point to a Wind object. So when you call the play( ) member function by saying 

ip->play(middleC);
the compiler can know only that its calling play( ) for an Instrument pointer, and call the base-class version of Instrument::play( ) instead of what it should do, which is call Wind::play( ). Thus, you wont get the correct behavior.

This is a significant problem; it is solved in Chapter 15 by introducing the third cornerstone of object-oriented programming: polymorphism (implemented in C++ with virtual functions).
