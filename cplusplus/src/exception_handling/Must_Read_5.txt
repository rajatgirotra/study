Throwing Standard Exceptions
You can throw standard exceptions inside your own library or program. All standard exception
classes that enable you to do this have only one parameter to create the exception: a string
(class string is described in Chapter 11) that will become the description returned by
what(). For example, the class logic_error is defined as follows:
namespace std {
class logic_error : public exception {
public:
explicit logic_error (const string& whatString);
};
}
The set of standard exceptions that provide this ability contains class logic_error and its
derived classes, class runtime_error and its derived classes, as well as class
ios_base::failure. Thus, you can't throw exceptions of the base class exception and any
exception class that is provided for language support.
To throw a standard exception, you simply create a string that describes the exception and use it
to initialize the thrown exception object:
string s;
...
throw out_of_range(s);
Implicit conversions from char* to string exist, so you can also use a string literal directly:
throw out_of_range("out_of_range exception (somewhere, somehow)");
