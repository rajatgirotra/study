Ranges
======
until c++17, the way to work with elements in a container and the standard algorithms is to use iterators.
algorithms would take two iterators pointing to the begin and end of sequence. and these begin and end functions would be
provided by the containers themselves. With C++20 however a new concept of range is introduced.

A range is an object that allows you to iterate over a sequence. A range object could be an array type or any other type that
allows begin() and end() functions. this change brings a lot of other changes

1) New implementation of standard algorithms which take range objects as arguments.
2) helper functions for creating and dealing with range objects
3) some concepts for ranges.

Note that by default, container classes (vector, list, deque, set, map etc) are ranges as they provide begin() and end() functions.

the new algorithms for working with ranges are defined in the std::ranges namespace.

Views
=====
views are lightweight ranges (i.e. they are also range objects only) that
1) reference other ranges and sub-ranges.
2) allow you to filter the elements of the referenced ranges
3) allow you to transform the elements of the referenced ranges
4) generate a sequence of values themselves.

To create these views. the standard provides a number of range adaptor functions in the std::ranges::views namespace.
namespace std {
namespace views = std::ranges::views; // so std::views is same as std::ranges::views
}

A few range adaptor functions we will see next are:
std::views::filter()
std::views::transform()
std::views::take()
std::views::keys(), std::views::values(), std::views::elements<N>()
std::views::iota()
etc.

std::views::elements<N>: If you have a view whose underlying is a sequence of tuple or pair, or if you have an associative container like map etc, then you can use elements<N> range adaptor to get a view of elements in the Nth type of the tuple, pair in your sequence or the Nth type in the map etc. So to get the keys of a map, you can say elements<0>. In fact, keys() and values() are just convenience functions for elements<0> and elements<1> respectively.

Note that all range and view objects are defined in std::ranges namespace and these adaptor functions are defined in std::views.
so ADL (argument dependent lookup won't work for these range adaptor functions which take range as their arguments, because ADL will only
search in std::ranges namespace. that is why the range adaptor functions should always be fully qualified.

generally, programmers do:
namespace rng = std::ranges;
namespace vws = std::views;

Never do this:
using namespace std::views; // this brings a number of common names in scope like transform, filter, keys etc which can very easily collide
with other functions or variable names; mostly leading to compile time errors and sometimes undefined behavior at runtime.

Let's see some range and views in action.

Note that views are designed to be non-mutating by default — they generally provide read-only, lazily-evaluated access to an underlying range or container. So it is not okay for views to mutate or transform the original values in the underlying container unless explicitly designed to do so. However, this is a sematic constraint and not something forced by a compiler.

Even the transform view should take an argument by value or by const reference and just return a mutated value, not modify the underlying value.

If there is ONE RULE you must remember when working with views, it is:
use views ad hoc (immediately after you define them).
