Let's next talk about Awaitables and Awaiters.

co_await is actually an operator. just like sizeof. So it can take something as an argument i.e. its operand. that something is called an Awaitable.
Now the various different implementations of an Awaitable are nothing but Awaiters. Awaiters have to provide three specific member functions to deal with
the suspension and resumption of a coroutine.

At this point, the difference between Awaitable and Awaiter seems blurry.

Awaitables are used whenever co_await and co_yield is called. co_await causes some member function in your awaiter to be called which can decide whether
to approve or reject the suspension, or perform any other logic for suspensions and resumptions.

std::suspend_always and std::suspend_never are examples of awaiters. Let's look at the three member functions.

1) bool await_ready() --> This is called immediately before a coroutine is suspended. If it returns true, the coroutine is not suspended at all.
Note that in this function, the coroutine is not suspended yet. So do not call resume() or destroy() in this function.

2) auto await_suspend(awaitHdl) --> This is called immediately after the coroutine is suspended. The argument is the std::coroutine_handle<> of the coroutine
that is suspended. The beauty of this function is its return type. In this function you can decide to immediately resume the suspended coroutine. You can also
transfer control to another coroutine. Different return types allow you to specify this in different ways. We will see examples in a bit.

3) auto await_resume() --> This is called immediately after the coroutine is resumed. It can return a value, which would be the value
 that the co_await/co_yield expression yields. It is used by the caller of the coroutine to send values back into the coroutine when a coroutine is resumed.


await_suspend(awaitHandle)
1) If it returns void, the coroutine is suspended.
2) await_suspend can also return a totally different coroutine_handle<> (maybe a sub-coroutine handle). In that case, the returned coroutine is resumed immediately. And since await_suspend() signals that there should be no suspension and some coroutine must run, await_resume() will never be called.

Coroutine constraints:
=====================
Coroutines are not allowed to have return statements.
Coroutines cannot be constexpr or consteval.
Coroutines cannot have return type auto or other placeholder types.
main() cannot be a coroutine.
A constructor or destructor cannot be a coroutine.
A coroutine may be static. A coroutine may be a member function if it is not a constructor or destructor.
A coroutine may even be a lambda. However, it should never capture anything. (it can, but it should NEVER)
Another advice is to never declare coroutine parameters as references. Otherwise, fatal runtime errors with
undefined behavior may occur.
