You have already seen FixFields.h in quickfix where we define classes for every field in FIX.

We can also extend that by creating our own user defined classes for our custom fields.
Quickfix provides useful macros for that already

eg:

MyUserDefineFields.hpp

namespace FIX
{
    USER_DEFINED_STRING(MyNewString, 9999);
	USER_DEFINED_PRICE(MyNewPrice, 9999);
}

Now you can say:

MyNewString stringField("string");
MyNewPrice priceField(14.54);
message.setField(stringField);
message.setField(priceField);

OR

message.getField(FIX::MyNewString);
message.getField(FIX::MyNewPrice);

//Not only this.
Infact you can create your own type in addition to what is supported by QuickFix. For that all you need to do is define
a new class for it and defines a Convertor to convert to and from string. More on this later when we'll actually see a need to do it.
