A margin is the amount calculated by a Clearing House (Central Counterparty) as necessary to cover the risk of financial loss on a
derivatives contract due to an adverse market movement.

If you only buy options, then margins are not payable. It is when you write options that margins may be payable.
Margins are paid to cover your obligations to your broker. Brokers in turn pay these margins to the Clearing House.
The Clearing House recalculates margins at the end of each day to ensure an adequate level of margin cover is maintained.
The Clearing House then debits or credits your account with your broker according to whether your margin obligation has increased or decreased.
Where there is a shortfall in your account you will usually be required to pay margins within 24 hours. When an obligation to the market no
longer exists, all margin amounts are credited back to your account with your broker.

Margin obligations are calculated at the end of trading each day and the clearing house notifies each broker of the margin obligations for
each of that broker’s accounts early the next trading day. As the broker is responsible for the margin obligations to the clearing house,
it is the broker who has the legal obligation to settle with the clearing house. Each broker’s total margin obligations must be lodged with the
clearing house by (say) 11.00 am the same day. To enable the broker to settle their daily margin obligations with the clearing house the broker will
generally ensure that their clients have deposited cash or collateral, such as securities, bank guarantees or any other pledged securities.
Margins from your broker may be different to the clearing house. the clearing house's margining methods calculate the margins required from your broker
(Clearing Participant). Your broker’s margin requirements for your account may be different to those of the clearing house if your broker uses a
different margining standard to the clearing house. Here we assume that your broker adopts the same margining as the clearing house.

The minimum level of cover required to cover margin obligations is equivalent to the liquidation value of your portfolio on the next trading day.

The primary role of CH is to act as central counterparty to trades executed by its members:
When CH has registered a trade, it becomes the buyer to every CH member who sells and the seller to every CH member who buys, ensuring the financial
performance of trades. To protect itself against the risks assumed as central counterparty, CH establishes a margin requirement from its members.

As central counterparty to its members' trades, CH is at risk from the default of a member. To limit and cover such potential loss, CH collects
margin on all open positions and recalculates members' margin liabilities on a daily basis. These are of 2 types

1] Initial Margin
2] Variation Margin


The amount specified for Initial Margin should not be excessive, but it also may not be set at a level that is too low. Oversecuring a position would
tie up liquidity of the exchange participant unnecessarily, while an undersecured position could represent a potential threat to the guarantee of
contract fulfillment.

Throughout this process, not only the losses calculated on the basis of current market prices, but also potential future price risks must be covered so
that no collateral shortfall arises prior to the next calculation of margin requirements. The job of an efficient margin system is to find the right
measure of protection for all market participants without causing an undue burden on any one of them and unnecessarily blocking liquidity.

The level of margin required from each member is re-calculated on a daily basis, because transactions made during the trading day lead to new positions
being established and existing ones being offset through appropriate opposite transactions. Nevertheless,Eurex Clearing AG calculates the margin during
the day and reserves the right to make an intraday margin call. In addition, this process again promotes liquidity. If margin requirements were continuously
measured on the basis of risk exposure up to the end of the contract term, this would lead to excessive margin being required due to the broad range of
price movements which could arise during the life of the contract.

Margin requirements are determined using a mathematical model with various parameters as well as current cash market prices. Among the most important
parameters is the volatility of the (underlying) security.

Volatility expresses the price variations that arise between consecutive trading days, whereby "historical volatility" (as its empirical counterpart)
acts as a means of comparison. Historical volatility, i.e. price movements observed in a given security during the past, provides a clue to the potential
maximum price range in which the instrument can be expected to trade in the future.

Once the minimum and maximum potential prices of the underlying security have been determined using the margin parameters, then the resulting theoretical
prices of the associated contracts are calculated. At Eurex Clearing AG, this calculation takes place with the help of various options pricing models.


TIMS takes into account the volatility of the underlying security when calculating your margin obligations. Volatility refers to the size and frequency
of price fluctuations.
TIMS arrives at a margin by calculating two margin components for each position:

1] the premium margin, and,
2] the risk margin.

The sum of these is the total margin.

The premium margin is the market value of the particular position at the close of business each day. For example, if an option is valued at $0.35 at the
close of business on day 1, the premium margin component of the total margin payable the following day would be $350 per contract. At the end of day 2,
if the option is valued at $0.45 the premium margin component of the total margin payable the following day would be $450 per contract.

Premium margin must be deposited by the writer of an option. It covers the potential loss that could be incurred if the writer were forced today to liquidate
the position.

Additional margin serves to cover through the next trading any potential additional costs that could arise if the positions had to be liquidated immediately.
These possible close-out costs would arise if, based on the current prices of contracts / securities held in an account, the worst case loss would occur during
the subsequent trading day.

The purpose of a margin system is to calculate sufficient margin requirement for each account. The margin requirement should theoretically be the market value of the account.
However, an account cannot normally be closed at the instant the participant defaults at the prevailing market prices. Normally, it takes time to neutralize the
account and the value of the account can change during this period. For a clearing organization the level of margins is of crucial importance. Low level of margins will
affect the counterparty risk of the clearing organization in a negative manner. Very high level of margins will limit the counterparty risk taken by the clearing
organization but may discourage trading.
