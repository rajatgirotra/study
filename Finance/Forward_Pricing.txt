FX Forward contract is an obligation where the two parties are obliged to exchange funds at a predefined exchange rate at a given time in future.
The forward pricing depends on

1) The current spot price.
2) The interest rates of the two currencies.

Consider that USD/INR spot price is 50.0
Let say one year interest rate in US in 4% and in India it is 8%

So in one year 1 USD will become 1(1+0.04), based on interest calculation.
You already know the formula for this, as you have studied this many times.

A * pow((1+r/m), mn)

where r is the interest rate per annum, m is compounding frequency and n is the number of years.

Similarly 50 INR will be 50(1+0.08)

This implies 

1 USD = 50 INR (now)
1 (1+.04) USD = 50 (1+.08) INR (in one year)
implies 

1 USD = 50 (1+0.08)
           -------  INR  (in one year)		   
		   (1+0.04)
		   
implies

1 USD = 51.92 in One year. This is the 1 year forward price for USD/INR

So a forward price is nothing but the spot price adjusted for the Interest rate differential of the two currencies.

Now the forward price - spot price is
51.92 - 50.0 = 1.92
We multiply the 1.92 with 10 to the power no.of decimals in the spot price (for USD/INR assume 2)
so 1.92 * 100 = 192 
This 192 is called the forward points or forward pips.
So forward points are quoted in pips.

Another example, consider USD/CAD

Forward Rate = Spot Rate X (1 + Interest Rate of Overseas/Foreign country)
                            ---------------------------------------------
                           (1 + Interest Rate of Domestic country)

USD/CAD spot rate = 1.0650 (4 decimal points)
CAD interest rate (1 year) = 3.64%
USD interest rate (1 year) = 3.15%
implies 
1 year USD/CAD forward price = 1.0650 * (1+0.0364)
                                        ---------   = 1.0700										
										(1+0.0315)										
Therefore forward points = (forward price - spot price) = 1.0700 - 1.0650 = 0.0050 * 1000 = 50 pips.

Notice this:

1) If the currency on the left hand side has a lower rate of interest than the currency on the right hand side,
then the forward points will always be positive. We call this as a forward premium.
2) If the currency on the left hand side has a higher rate of interest than the currency on the right hand side,
then the forward points will always be negative. We call this as a forward discount (eg, see EUR/CHF forward points online, as EUR interest rates
are higher than CHF interest rates)
