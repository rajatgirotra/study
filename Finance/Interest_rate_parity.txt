Interest rate parity tells you how closely are interest rates linked to FX forward rates
Basically the assumption is that the "hedged" returns from investing in different currencies should be the same,
regardless of the level of their interest rates.

Forward rates should incorporate the difference in interest rates between the two currencies, otherwise an arbitrage opportunity would exist.
For example:

a) borrow a currency with a lower rate of interest
b) exchange it at the current exchange rate.
c) invest at a higher rate of interest
d) or hedge the exchange risk by buy a forward contract to convert the proceeds in step c) back to the first currency

The cost of hedging negates the higher returns that would acrus from investing in a currency that offers a higher interest rate.
So the returns would be the same as those obtained from investing in the lower interest rate currency.
