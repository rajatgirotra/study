Sockets are an inter-process network communication implementation using an Internet Protocol (IP) stack on an
Ethernet transport. Sockets are language and protocol independent and available to "C", Perl, Python, Ruby and
Java (and more) programmers. The "C" language BSD API is used on Linux, all popular variants of Unix,
Microsoft Windows (NT,2000,XP,... and later) and even embedded OSs like VxWorks. It is by far the most popular 
implementation of inter-process network communication.

Sockets allow one process to communicate with another whether it is local on the same computer system or remote 
over the network. Many other higher level protocols are built upon sockets technology.

The sockets API provides many configuration options so we will try and cover the socket API components and then 
give examples of a few implementations. It would be very difficult to cover all variations of its use.
