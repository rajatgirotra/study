What is YUM?
Yum stands for Yellowdog Updater, Modified.
It's a repository management tool for RedHat, Centos, Fedora and many other linux distributions
used for software package installation.

Software installation is done using RPM (RedHat Package Manager). So understand the difference between YUM and RPM

YUM is used to manage different repositories which host RPM packages, getting information about those packages
etc.

while RPM is an archive which can be pulled from the repository using YUM and then extracted.

Creating a new YUM repository is very simple:
1) Create an empty directory, example: /var/yum
2) Copy all the rpm files which you want to host in your repository.
3) Create metadata for your repository. This is done using the createrepo command. Install using yum if this is not available
4) Add the repository information in your yum configuration.
