The “disadvantage” to using the Java containers is that you lose type
information when you put an object into a container. This happens
because the programmer of that container class had no idea what specific
type you wanted to put in the container, and making the container hold
only your type would prevent it from being a general-purpose tool. So
instead, the container holds references to Object, which is the root of all
the classes so it holds any type.

Since the type information is lost, the only thing the container
knows that it holds is a reference to an object. You must perform a
cast to the correct type before you use it.

But Java won’t let you misuse the objects that you put into a
container. If you throw a dog into a container of cats and then try to treat
everything in the container as a cat, you’ll get a RuntimeException
when you pull the dog reference out of the cat container and try to cast it
to a cat.
