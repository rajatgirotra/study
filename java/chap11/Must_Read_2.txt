JAVA Containers are available in two categories
-----------------------------------------------

1] Containers:
1.a] List - holds elements in the order in which they were inserted.
1.b] Set  - Cannot have duplicate elements and you should not rely on the order in which elements are inserted in a Set.
1.c] Queue - a queue produces the elements in the order specified in the queuing discipline.

2] Map - These are associative containers. Just like an ArrayList() is a container in which the index is an integer
a Map is a container in which the key is some user defined object.
