Create an interface with at least one method, in its own package.
Create a class in a separate package. Add a protected inner class that implements the interface.

In a third package, inherit from your class and, inside a method, return an object of the protected
inner class, upcasting to the interface during the return.

Please read intfpack.IOne.java, classpack.COne.java and thirdpack.CTwo.java next
