Annotations are especially useful when you want some sort of additional information to accompany your source files.
For example, when you are working with frameworks such as EJB's, web services, Hibernate etc, you need an external
descriptor file. This way you end up with two separate sources of information about a class, which usually leads to
code synchronization problems. In such cases, you can use annotation to generate those external files for you
automatically. 

Next we'll see how we can write some annotations to generate code for creating a database table, given the 
java bean class.


We'll need an annotation at the class level to get the name of the db table. Then we'll need annotations for 
various constraints on fields/columns in the db table. Then we'll need annotations to define the type of fields.
String, Integer etc.

Please read DBTable.java next.
