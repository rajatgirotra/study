Java has introduced a formal way of combining metadata togther with the Java source code.
Using Annotations you can provide information that you need to fully describe your prgram, but that cannot be
expressed in Java. You basically they allow you to store extra information in your code in a proper format
which is verified and tested by your compiler. They can be used to

1] Generate descriptor files.
2] Generate new class definitions.

There is also an annotations API to help you to build processing tools for your annotations.
In general, the kind of annotations you add and what you do with them is entirely up to you.

java.lang provides three standard annotations:

1] @Override, to indicate that a method definition is intented to override a method in its base class.
2] @Deprecated, to produce a compiler warning if you try to use a deprecated element.
3] @SuppressWarnings, to turn off inappropriate compiler warnings.

Java has introduced the "@" (at the rate) sign to specify annotations.
