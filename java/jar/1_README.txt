jat is Java archiving tool to create zipped up archives of:
1) java classes that make up your application/module.
2) a metadata file called manifest file (META-INF/MANIFEST.MF).
3) optional resource files like images/audio files etc.. (exmaple, in case your jar contains an applet class which needs some audio and image files to display in the browser).
