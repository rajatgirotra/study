You already know basics of Java classes.
 1) Java classes can be grouped in a package using package statement
 2) Top level Java classes can have access specifier of only public OR <EMPTY>.
 public means anyone can access the class
 <EMPTY> means that class can only be accessed within the package only
 3) Java allows constructor chaining. i.e. one constructor can call another one using this() syntax.
 4) See a sample class Account with some getters and setters and ctors generated using "Generate" feature in Intellij.
