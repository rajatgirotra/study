You now know that Runnable.run() does not return any value. It returns void.
If you want a task to return a value. You can use the Callable interface. The Callable interface is defined as follows:

interface Callable<V> {
	V call();
}

Here the type parameter V actually represents the return type of task. and instead of implementing the run() method, you should not
implement the call() method.

Also you must invoke this thread using ExecutorService.submit() method. This method also returns on object which implements the
Future interface. Interface future is defined as:
 interface Future<V> {
 	V get()
 	...// other 4-5 methods
 }
 
 where the parameter type V is the type returned  by call(). So you can use the Future<V>.get() call to get the actual return value.
