Regular Expressions
-------------------

-? --->> Zero or one occurrence of - sign.
So ? indicates zero or one occurrence of the preceding character.

In other languages, a \ means that the next character has special meaning. For eg: a \d means a digit.
In JAVA however a \\ indicates that the next character has special meaning. So \\d means a digit.
a \\\\ means a literal \. \t and \n mean general tab & newline characters.

+ means one or more occurrence of the preceding character.
so -?\\d+ means a possibly minus sign followed by one or more digits.

(-|\\+)? - represents a possible minus or plus sign. Since + has special meaning in regular
expressions, it needs to be escaped here.

\\W - represents a non word character
\\W+ - represents one or more occurrences of non-word characters.
\\w i.e. a lowercase w means a word character. i.e. 'a' or 'x' or 'P' i.e. a single alphabet.
\\s - represents a whitespace
\\S - represents a non-whitespace
\\d - represents a digit
\\D - represents a non-digit
\\b - represents a search at a word boundary
\\B - represents a search at a non-word boundary.
