Please read SimpleFormat.java first

JAVA Strings
-------------

The JAVA String object is immutable. So whenever you call the toLowerCase(), toUpperCase() & like functions, you actually get a
reference to a new String.

Prior to JDK-5, JAVA used the StringBuffer class because it ensured thread safety; so it was very expensive. From JDK-5 onwards
JAVA uses the StringBuilder class.

Decompiling a class file
------------------------
use javap tool, provided in the bin folder.
usage:
-----
javap -c <ClassName> //remember only class name eg: javap -c SimpleFormat & not javap -c SimpleFormat.class
