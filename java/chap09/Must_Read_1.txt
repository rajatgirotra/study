Exception arguments:

Like any object in Java, you always create exceptions on the heap using new, which allocates storage and calls a constructor.
There are two constructors in all standard exceptions: the first is the default constructor, and the second takes a string argument so you can place pertinent
information in the exception:

throw new NullPointerException("t = null");

This string can later be extracted using various methods, as you’ll see.
