Please read Must_Read_2.txt first

Now to launch this simple Swing based GUI app using Java Web Start in the following way:

1) Create a Jar file out of this project.
2) Java Web Start applications are launched via Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP).
   So we need to create a JNLP file.
   
Next we create the JNLP file as follows:

/*
Please read dynamic_tree.jnlp next
You may not completely understand the jnlp contents as of now,
but you will in due course.

You should read rajat.jnlp.txt where I have tried to explain most of the stuff.

After that please read deployment.txt
