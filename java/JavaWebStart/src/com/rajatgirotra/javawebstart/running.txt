Please read deployment.txt first.

There are three ways to run a java web start application.1

Browser
1) Open the browser, click the link to the jnlp and you are done.

Java Cache Viewer
2) If you have java 6 or above, then you can use the java cache viewer. Java 6 or higher caches all web start applications locally,
   so you don't need to start the web browser every time. Just go to ControlPanel->Java->General->View (to open the java cache viewer)
   and launch the application from there.
   
Desktop
3) From the Java cache viewer, you can select "Install Shortcuts" which will place desktop shortcuts to launch the application.
