1) Java Web Start is a software that is bundled with the JRE. Not need to install it separately.
2) It enables you to download & launch Java applications through the click of a button. 
3) There is no need to go through any installation procedures.
4) The application downloaded is also cached for faster performance.
5) The Java Web Start software can also specify the JRE version needed to run a Java application
   and can also download the required JRE.
6) The Java Web Start uses security inherent in the Java platform. Also, applications
   have restricted access to local drives and network resources.
7) Upgraded versions of the Java application can be downloaded and run by default.
8) Different clients can have different versions of the JRE or even different OS'es. It works equally well
   with Windows, Linux, Solaris or Mac.
9) You can also create a quick launch type of shortcut on your desktop.

Next we'll create a Swing based GUI application, which we'll launch through Java Web Start.
