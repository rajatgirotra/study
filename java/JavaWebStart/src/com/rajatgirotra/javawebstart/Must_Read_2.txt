I really dont know how to use getResources() at this moment, but will eventually get to know it.

Use the getResource method to read resources from a JAR file. For example, the following code retrieves
images from a JAR file.

// Get current classloader
ClassLoader cl = this.getClass().getClassLoader();

// Create icons
Icon saveIcon  = new ImageIcon(cl.getResource("images/save.gif"));
Icon cutIcon   = new ImageIcon(cl.getResource("images/cut.gif"));
