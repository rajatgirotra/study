Ok now that you have your jnlp file and the jar file, there are two ways to deploy your application.

1) You create an HTML page in which you use the Java Deployment Toolkit and its functions to launch your
   Java web start application. This also makes use of Javascript.  
   
2) The other easy way is that you just inclue a direct link to your jnlp file in the browser and that's it :)
   The only thing is that you cannot take advantage of the additional checks that the Deployment Toolkit functions provide.
   
   <a href="/absolute path to JNLP file/dynamictree_webstart.jnlp">Launch Notepad Application</a>
   
   
a) Then you just place the application's JAR file, JNLP file, and HTML page in the appropriate folders.

b) For this example, place DynamicTree.jar, dynamictree.jnlp, and JavaWebStartAppPage.html in the same directory on the local machine
   or a web server. A web server is not required to test the Java Web Start application.

c) Open the application's HTML page in a browser to view the application.

d) You might need to configure your web server to handle Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) files.
   If the web server is not set up properly, the Java Web Start application will not launch when you click on the link to the JNLP file.
   Configure the web server so that files with the .jnlp extension are set to the application/x-java-jnlp-file MIME type.
   The specific steps to set up the JNLP MIME type will vary depending on the web server. As an example, to configure an Apache web server,
   you should add the following line to the mime.types file.

   application/x-java-jnlp-file JNLP
   
   For other web servers, check the documentation for instructions on setting MIME types.
