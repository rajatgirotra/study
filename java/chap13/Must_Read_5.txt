Creating instances of Generic Types
----------------------------------

The attempt to create a new T() in Erased.java failed partly because of erasure, and partly because the compiler could not figure
out that there exists a default(no-arg) c'tor. But for C++ templates, this is straightforward and easy.

template <class T>
class Foo 
{
	T x;
	T* y;
	Foo()
	{
		y = new T();
	}
}

main()
{
	Foo<Bar> hi;
	Foo<int> bye; //works for primitives as well.
}

But the same thing does not work in JAVA as JAVA does not have generic type information inside the generic code.
So the approach we can take is to pass the Class object for the generic type in the c'tor of the Generic class and then use
Class.newInstance() method.

InstantiateGenericType.java does exactly this.
