Supertype Wildcards
-------------------

A supertype wildcard can be one of the following:

List<? super MyClass> - This means that the wildcard can be any base class of MyClass.
This means that you can put inside the list MyClass or any type derived from MyClass. 

List<? super T> - This means that the wildcard can be any base class of the generic type parameter T
This means that you can put inside the list T or any type derived from T.


// Not allowed
List<T super Myclass> - You cannot give a generic type parameter a supertype bound.
