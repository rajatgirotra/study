Bounds
------

Bound in JAVA generics do two things:

1] They allow you to place constraints on what types can be used with your generic class.
2] The second, more important one, is that they allow you to call methods of the bound types. (There can be 
multiple bound types as you'll see)

You can place a bound on you generic types by resuing the JAVA "extends" keyword.
Note that "extends" in JAVA generics has a completely different meaning than what it means ordinarily.
