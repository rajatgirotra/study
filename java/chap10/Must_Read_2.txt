There’s a third form of RTTI in Java. This is the keyword instanceof that
tells you if an object is an instance of a particular type. It returns a
boolean so you use it in the form of a question, like this:

if(x instanceof Dog)
((Dog)x).bark();

The above if statement checks to see if the object x belongs to the class
Dog before casting x to a Dog. It’s important to use instanceof before a
downcast when you don’t have other information that tells you the type of
the object; otherwise you’ll end up with a ClassCastException.
