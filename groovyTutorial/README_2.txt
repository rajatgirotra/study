Please read 1.groovy first

Many times when you run groovy, you would like to use other 3rd party jar files. To use them do the following

1] Set the CLASSPATH environment variable.
2] Pass -cp to the command you used to create the shell or run the script.
3] Place all jars in ~/.groovy/lib/ folder

You can also set JAVA_OPTS to increase the amount of memory allocated for running your groovy scripts.
