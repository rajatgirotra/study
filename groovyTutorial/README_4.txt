Please read 3.groovy first.

There are a number of ways in which you can integrate Groovy and Java.

1] There is an ant task groovyc which compiles your groovy sources into bytecode and then can be used with Java code.

2] The other way is to embed groovy source directly into Java code.

We will have a look at these options later. We will also explore the ant task and the groovy plugin for maven later.
