What it is?

You already know about the Javascript DOM. It is a representation of the data in a web browser.
When we write Javascript, we are essentially just manipulating the DOM, and updating the HTML.
So in Javascript, we do two things:

1) Manipulate DOM (data, ie the variables and data in your javascript)
2) Update HTML (ie the view).

AngularJS tries to implement a Model View Controller type of design pattern, where the controller is the glue between the modal and the view.
It creates a two way binding between the data and the view, so that if you update the data, the HTML updates itself
and if you update the view, the data updates itself.
