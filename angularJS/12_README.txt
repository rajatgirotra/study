XMLHttpRequest Object is part of Javascript which is used to send an HTTP request from withoin Javascript; without having to type the complete path in the browser.
It is used heavily in Ajax programming, where a user keeps working on the page, and the javascript can simulatenously send an HTTP Request and display the response without
having to refresh the page. Developed by Microsoft but is now standard. Can also be used to fetch other data like JSON  etc not just XML and works for other protocols also
like file:// and ftp:// not only HTTP.

Many javascript libraries have wrappers over this object so you dont need to directly use it. Angular also has a wrapper in the form of a $http service. Lets look at it now.
