We will be learning Javascript, Jquery, AngularJS, Bootstrap, HTML all side by side.

You already know what these are:
Javascript - just a language to manipulate data on client side and update HTML dynamically, basically making a web page interactive
Jquery - A library of utilities written in Javascript
Bootstrap - A framework of CSS classes and Javascript libraries.

To use Bootstrap's CSS classes and Javascript libraries, you can either download Bootstrap from web locally
and include them in your HTML using the <link> tag by specifying the location of the bootstrap css file downloaded locally
OR
you can use the link tag and specify a location on the web where it can download the bootstrap css and javascript straightaway.
So you dont need to download anything.

Similarly for jquery. Just include a link tag in head tag specifying the location of the jquery library.
