Managing, configuring, monitoring Websphere MQ

1) Using commands called MQ Script commands (MQSC). For example, the command.
   DEFINE QLOCAL(MY.QUEUE) DESCR(‘Test Queue’) DEFPSIST(YES)
   defines a new MQ.
   
2) By sending and receiving messages on some well known queue names defined by IBM MQ. These
   messages have to be in the well known format called PCF (Programmable Command Format).
   
3) Use MQ explorer application, which is an eclipse based tool shipped with IBM MQ.

We'll learn about the details later.

However, there are two products that are frequently used alongside WebSphere MQ:

1) Websphere Message Broker.
2) Websphere Application Broker

I'll learn about these later.
