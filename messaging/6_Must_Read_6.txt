Configuring an MQ.

Step 1
------
Create the Q Manager. this is done by a IBM MQ administrator.
Command:   crtmqm QMA   (Names are case - sensitive)

You can create as many Q managers on a machine (server) as you may like. and you can also define a default q manager 
to be used if your application does not specify any. But this is usually not a good practice and the application must
explicitly specify the q manager to use

Step 2
-------
Start the Q manager.
Command: strmqm QMA
It is now possible for applications to start putting and getting messages; the administrator can perform additional configuration
by using the WebSphere MQ administration tools.


Step 3
------
Create or Configure other MQ objects
All other MQ objects will be actually children of this MQ manager. You can use the 

"runmqsc <Q Manager Name>" command to bring up a prompt where you can create/configure other MQ objects.

Step 4
-------
Create a local queue.

Starting MQSC for queue manager QMA.

define qlocal('QUEUE1')
1 : define qlocal('QUEUE1')
AMQ8006: WebSphere MQ queue created.
define channel('TO.QMB') chltype(sdr) xmitq('QMB') conname(hostB)
2 : define channel('TO.QMB') chltype(sdr) xmitq('QMB') conname(hostB)
AMQ8014: WebSphere MQ channel created.
define qlocal('QMB') usage(xmitq)
3 : define qlocal('QMB') usage(xmitq)
AMQ8006: WebSphere MQ queue created.
end
4 : end
3 MQSC commands read.
No commands have a syntax error.
All valid MQSC commands were processed.

ALWAYS REMEMBER, MQ object names (like, TO.QMB, QMB) are case sensitive.
