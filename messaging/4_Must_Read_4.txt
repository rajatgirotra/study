Implementation Details:

You already know the format of an MQ Message from Must_Read_2.txt.

1) MQMD - The MQ message descriptor has a fixed format that describes the message. Some the most important fields are:

   a) MsgType 
      Values can be
	     a.1) Datagram - i.e. the sender is not expecting any response back.
		 a.2) Request
		 a.3) Reply
		 a.4) Report

   b) MessageID and CorrelationID - These are 24 bytes fields which is used to map request to reply messages. The application program can choose
      to set one or both of these values or let the Websphere MQ generate messageID by itself. Normally the following protocol is followed.
	  
	  THE WEBSPHERE MQ WILL GENERATE THE MESSAGEID AND THE RECEIVER APPLICATION WILL JUST COPY THE MESSAGE ID IN THE CORRELATION ID FIELD OF THE REPLY MESSAGE.
	  THIS WILL ALLOW THE SENDER APPLICATION TO REQUEST A PARTICULAR REPLY MESSAGE INSTEAD OF JUST GETTING THE FIRST MESSAGE FROM THE HEAD OF THE Q.
	  
   c) Persistence Flag selects whether the message must be treated as persistent, i.e recoverable in case of a failure or not.
   
   d) Priority - Value between 1 and 10. So instead of retrieving in priority order, rather than true first in first out sequence.
   
   e) PutTime and PutDate - The time and date when the message was put to the queue.
   
   f) Expiry Time - When the message in the queue have no significance and can be safely deleted.
   
   g) ReplyToQ and ReplyToQMgr - When sending a request message, the responding application can be told where to send the reply. This is usually
      done by providing the ReplyToQ and ReplyToQMg names in the initial request.
	  
   h) Format - To define the format of the payload. MQSTR for string data, NONE for binary data.
   
   i) PutApplType and PutApplName - information on the sending application name and type.
   
   j) Report field - The MQ Mgr can send a notification to the sending application when it puts the message on the Q or when the receving application takes it off the Q.
   
   k) BackoutCount - 
   
   l) Messages can be grouped together using the GroupID and MsgSeqNumber fields in the MQMD descriptor. When all messaged in a group have arrived, only then will they
      be sent for processing.

	  
2) 	Userdefined properties and Values - The sending application can define its own property names and values, which can be read by the receiving application. 
    Properties can be strings, numbers and boolean values.
	Message properties are most commonly used in publish/subscribe applications to provide an additional layer of selection beyond just the topic. It is similar to an SQL query using the WHERE
	clause to return specific rows from a database table.
