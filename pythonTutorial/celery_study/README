Celery is a distributed message Q. ie you can Q task objects which are nothing but callables. These callables are then run asynchronously by Celery.
Celery

Pre-requisites
--------------
Celery needs a message broker to Q and DQ tasks. There are several options available
1) RabbitMQ
2) Redis
3) Others

I choose RabbitMQ
How to install RabbitMQ - RabbitMQ depends on erlang. So we must install erlang.
Download erlang source code from their website and do
 cd otp_src_19.2
 export ERL_TOP=<above directory>
 "configure, make, make install".
After that install the RabbitMQ generic binary package.

./rabbitmq-server - simply starts the rabbitmq server on localhost

Celery process can call the tasks asynchronously or synchronously. It also supports scheduling.
Also tasks can be called in a single thread or in multiple threads using python multiprocessing,
gevent or Eventlet etc.

Read tasks.py
