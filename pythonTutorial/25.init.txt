#!/usr/bin/env python3

## Just like each module has its own private symbol table, so you dont have to worry about conflicting global variables in other modules,
## similarly you can place your module files in python packages so that there is no conflicting modules with the same name.

## if you have a directory structue like 

sound/
	formats/
	effects/
	filters/

where each of the folders can contain python modules, you must place a file __init__.py (usually empty file)
This is how python recognizes the folder as part of a python package. Otherwise, python will never traverse the directoy contents or subdirectories to find for modules.

So now you given that you have __init__.py, in each of these directories, you can say

import sound.effects.echo ## which loads the echo submodule.
and then you can use it like:

sounds.effects.echo.echoFilter(args)




You can also say

from sounds.effects import echo

echo.echoFilter(args)


or from sound.effects.echo import echoFilter

echoFilter(args)
