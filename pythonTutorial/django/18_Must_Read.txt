Each django app has a corresponding admin project to manage site content.
You need to create a superuser to manage site content. and access this using :
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

Create a super user using:

python manage.py creatsuperuser

After you create a user, you need to create classes derived from django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin
You can register mutiple model classes with ModelAdmin class, and then customize the admin site using various options to see what is best for your implementation.

Eg:
class Person(models.Model):
    pass


class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass

admin.site.register(Person, PersonAdmin)


OR use a decorator

@admin.register(Person)
class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass

See ModelAdmin for a list of customizations available or see the mysite/posts/admin.py to know more.

Also to deal with Databases, there are normally four operations
CREATE
RETRIEVE
UPDATE
DELETE

These four operations can be triggered by the django admin using for HTTP methods
POST
GET
PUT/PATCH
DELETE

All the above are http methods we are going to use in our app.
