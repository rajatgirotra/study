A <form></form> is an HTML element which includes one or more other elements. The information entered in these elements can be sent back to the server.

In Django, you have a Form class where you can define multiple Form fields. Each field corresponds to an HTML element which is displayed by Django automatically. Each form field also has a default Widget class which tells which HTML markup will be used. For example, for CharField(), the markup could be an <input type="text"> element. However, you can also override this to be whatever you want.

2) Views (You already know)
3) Templates (These are HTML blueprints which you allow you do dynamically create content and then render it)
in Django, Controller is Django itself.
