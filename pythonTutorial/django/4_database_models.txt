In django, you need to create models. Models are classes which derive from django.db.models.Model class. These classes provide an ORM (Object Relational Mapping). Ie the definition of a model is used to generate corresponding database tables, columns, constraints, keys etc.

How it is done.

Step 1
======
Create a model class (ie class deriving from models.Model). Define members in this class which will become fields

Step 2
======
Make sure your app is listed in the INSTALLED_APPS variable in settings.py. When you generate an app, a python file is created called apps.py which has a class called PollsConfig which derives from AppConfig. You need to add this class in INSTALLED_APPS (ie polls.apps.PollsConfig)


Step 3
======
run "python manage.py makemigrations polls". A migration in django is basically a change that you have made to your model. ie you have added/deleted/modified a model. makemigrations will generate the SQL corresponding to your model change. SQL generated is obviously based on the SQL server we are using. For this case, a file called polls/migrations/0001_initial.py is generated.

You can view the SQL generated by running
"python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001" --> this will dump the SQL. It is always good to checkin the migration/change files in your repository so you have a history of changes/migrations

Run "python manage.py check". This checks if there are any problems in your project without actually touching your database.

Run "python manage.py migrate" will run all your changes/migrations against the database. django always remembers which migrations have already been applied by using a table django_migrations which has a list of migrations applied for each app.

Now lets add polls/models.py to add Question and Choice model
