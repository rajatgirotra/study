Django Template Options
-----------------------

'autoescape' : default is True. This will automatically convert characters like <, > and other to &lt; &gt; etc in generated HTML code
               Most often no need to change unless you are rendering NON-HTML. Can also turn it off in your template like this:
               {% autoescape off %}
               {{ body }}
               {% autoescape %}

'context_processors' : List of context_processors which are executed when you create a RequestContext object.

'debug': True - When true, errors in template rendering display a detailed page showing errors.

'loaders': List of loaders classes

and some others.

We are not discussing Jinja2 options for now.
