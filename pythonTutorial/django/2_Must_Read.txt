the url() function in urlpatterns list in mysite/urls.py has the following signature

url(regex, view, kwargs, name)
regex is the pattern to match in the URL.
view is the function that will be called when a particular URL matches.
kwargs will be  keyword arguments passed to the function along with the HttpRequest Object.
name is a unique name for ur URL - allows you to refer to your URL uniquely from multiple places from Django.

Ok in mysite/mysite/settings.py - You have ROOT_URLCONF variable. This is set to the name of a module.
This module must have a "urlpatterns" variable which is a list of url() instances.

Each url() instance is look'ed up in sequence. The first that matches, its corresponding view (ie function) is called.
The regex can also have named or unnamed groups. When a regex matches

1) The unnamed groups that match are passed as positional arguments.
2) The named groups that match are passed as a dictionary
3) The keyword args passed to the url() function are also passed as a dictionary. An item in named group with the same key as specified in url() is overriden with value from the url() instance.
4) the second argument of url() can also be the include() function, where the argument is the module name where again urlpatterns must be defined. This is a way of forwarding the url resolution.
5) Alternatively, the include() can also take a list of url() instances also instead of a module name

example:
urlpatterns = [
    # always preceed the regex with 'r' to tell python that its a raw string and  do not escape any characters.
    url(r'^articles/2003/$', views.special_case_2003),
    url(r'^articles/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/$', views.year_archive),
    url(r'^articles/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/(?P<month>[0-9]{2})/$', views.month_archive),
    url(r'^articles/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/(?P<month>[0-9]{2})/(?P<day>[0-9]{2})/$', views.article_detail),
    ]

A request to /articles/2005/03/ would call the function views.month_archive(request, year='2005', month='03'), instead of views.month_archive(request, '2005', '03').
A request to /articles/2003/03/03/ would call the function views.article_detail(request, year='2003', month='03', day='03').

Your first urlpatterns list defined in ROOT_URLCONF must also define support for un-resolved urls using one of the four supported variables.
handler400 – See django.conf.urls.handler400.
handler403 – See django.conf.urls.handler403.
handler404 – See django.conf.urls.handler404.
handler500 – See django.conf.urls.handler500.


urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^community/', include('django_website.aggregator.urls')),
    url(r'^contact/', include('django_website.contact.urls')),
   ]
