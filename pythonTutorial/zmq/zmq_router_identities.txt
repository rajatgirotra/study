Please read zmq_req_rep_router_dealer.txt first

ZMQ ROUTER creates random identity string to identify which peers it is connected to.
So it maintains an internal hash table of identity to connection object.

However, whenever a peer connects to a router socket, the peer can set the ZMQ_IDENTITY socket option
in advance (before connecting to ROUTER), and give an identity of its own. In that case, the ROUTER
will use the peer specified string as the connection identity instead of generating a random string
of its own. Let's see this next. Also we have downloaded a zhelpers.py file from github, which has some
helper functions for zmq.
