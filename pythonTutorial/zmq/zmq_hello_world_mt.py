# Here the "work" is just a one-second pause. We could do anything in the workers,
# including talking to other nodes. This is what the MT server looks like in terms of Ã˜MQ sockets
# and nodes. Note how the request-reply chain is REQ-ROUTER-queue-DEALER-REP.

# Next we'll see how to signal between the threads in ZMQ. The ONLY WAY of signalling between thread
# is by sending ZMQ messages on the sockets.

# We'll use PAIR sockets for that. Read zmq_PAIR_signalling.py next
