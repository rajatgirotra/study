Working with PAIR sockets have a limitation
1) They dont reconnect if client/server go down and come back again. Ie. they are not disconnected
transports like tcp is in ZMQ. They are connected transport.

So now let say you want to coordinate amongst many nodes (hosts) on a network, then you cannot use
PAIR socket types. Nodes come and go all the time. using PAIR sockets with threads in a process is ok
as threads are static, but nodes are dynamic.

Let say you are a PUB socket and you know before hand that there are going to be 10 subscribers.
And you want to wait for all 10 SUB to be available before you start xferring data.
In such a case, you can use say REQ-REP amongst the PUB and 10 SUB. each SUB sends a REQ to PUB process
when it is up. the PUB increments it count and sends a reply. When all 10 have connected, the PUB will
start sending subscription messages.
