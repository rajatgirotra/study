What is a node in ZMQ?
A node can be a thread (if using inter thread xport), a process (if using ipc xport), or a physical host (if using tcp or udp xports)

Very trivial
-----------
1) Request Reply - Used for RPC mostly.
2) Publish Subscribe
3) Pipeline - Connects nodes in a fan-out/fan-in mode. Used for parallel task distribution. Nothing but the PUSH/PULL model.
4) Exclusive Pair - Used for a one-to-one communication b/w two threads in a proess.

Message Frames
--------------
A ZMQ message could be made of multiple frames. Each frame is a length-specified sequence of binary data. Each frame is identified as a zmq_msg_t object in the ZMQ C API. Higher level API provide wrapper functions to send entire multipart message (message with multiple frames) together. But at the lower level API, each frame is sent separately.

1) ZMQ can send message with length zero. Used mostly for signaling an event from one thread to another
2) ZMQ guarantees to deliver either all the frames of a message or None.
3) ZMQ doesnt send the frame out right away. Its queued and sent at some later time. So all the frames of a message must fit in memory for the entire message to be delivered properly.
