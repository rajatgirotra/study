## There are a number of ways in which you can format the output

## Use the write() function of the file object. The reference to the standard output is called sys.stdout
## Use the various functions of the string module.
## Use the str() or repr() function.
## Use the str.format() function.

I am not going to anything here and I expect you learn this on the go.


Reading & Writing files

1) Use the open() command to open files for reading & writing
   open (filename, mode) 

mode can be 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'r+' for reading & writing, 'rb' for reading binary files. 

In text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-specific line endings (\n on Unix, \r\n on Windows) to just \n. When writing in text mode,
the default is to convert occurrences of \n back to platform-specific line endings. This behind-the-scenes modification to file data is fine for text files,
but will corrupt binary data like that in JPEG or EXE files. Be very careful to use binary mode when reading and writing such files.
