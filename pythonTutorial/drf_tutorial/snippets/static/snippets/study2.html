<!-- CSS position property --
position specified how the element will be visible relative to the viewport. Valid
values are "static", "relative", "fixed" and "absolute".

1)
position: static -> is the default value. Means the element will scroll as the page scrolls.
Standard behavior

2)
position: relative -> is the position relative to the standard "static" position. You have to
club position: relative with other properties "top", "right", "bottom", "left" to specify
where to position the element. Example:
position:relative
left: 30px
is similar to margin-left: 30px

3)
position: fixed -> element is fixed relative to viewport. i.e as you scroll and viewport changes, the
element will redraw itself on the viewport. This property is used to fix an element on a page even
if you scroll. Again you have to combine it with "top, right, bottom, left"

4)
position: absolute -> absolute means RELATIVE to a parent element with a position property.
So this element will be positioned relative to its parent position. given that the parent position
property should not be "static". If it is "static", the child property with "absolute" will behave
like "static" too

CSS Overflow property - Very simple. Many times you create an element with a fixed width and height
and the content in the element is too big to fit in that element. Like creating a div with some fixed
width and height and then putting too much text content into it. In such cases, the overflow property
can be used.

overflow: visible -> Do nothing, the overflow content will spill out of the element. This isn't very neat
overflow: hidden -> The overflow content will be clipped. ie hidden.
overflow: scroll -> Provide scrolling capability and don't spill
overflow: auto -> same as scroll, but works if height is above a certain value
