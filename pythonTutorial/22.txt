All python modules have a PRIVATE GLOBAL SYMBOL TABLE. So your module can define as many global variables without being afraid that they will clash with other global variables defined in any other users
modules. Also, the functions defined in your module can access these global variables. In your imported module, you can access the global variables just like you access functions, using moduleName.itemname syntax. 

Also instead of importing the complete module, you can also import functions selectively using the "from" syntax

Eg:

 from fibo import fib, fib2

in such a case in the imported module, the fibo module name is not known.
