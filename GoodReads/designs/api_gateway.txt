Usually in cloud microservices architecture, where a client can sends requests to servers via an API, there is an API Gateway in the middle which is responsible for doing multiple things, like:

1. support rate limiting,
2. SSL termination
3. authentication
4. IP whitelisting
5. servicing static content
