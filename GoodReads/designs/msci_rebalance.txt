The high trading volume at the close of equity markets during MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International) rebalancing is driven by several factors related to how MSCI indices are widely used by institutional investors, including mutual funds, pension funds, and ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). Here's why:

Index Tracking: Many institutional investors manage funds that track MSCI indices. When MSCI announces changes to its indices (like adding or removing stocks), these funds must adjust their portfolios to match the new index composition. Since the rebalancing takes effect at the close of the trading day, funds will execute trades at that time to minimize tracking error.

Liquidity Considerations: Trading at the close allows investors to take advantage of the liquidity provided by other market participants who are also rebalancing. The last few minutes of the trading day typically see increased liquidity, reducing the market impact of large trades.

Minimizing Tracking Error: MSCI uses the closing prices to calculate the index value. By executing trades as close to the market close as possible, investors can ensure that their portfolios closely track the index as of the rebalancing date.

Market Orders and Volume: The rebalancing process often involves significant changes in the volume of shares traded. To handle this, many trades are executed using market-on-close (MOC) orders, which are designed to be filled at the closing price. This leads to a surge in trading activity right before the market closes.

Anticipation and Arbitrage: Some traders may try to anticipate the rebalancing and trade ahead of the expected moves, further increasing volume. Arbitrage opportunities might arise as traders try to profit from discrepancies between the expected and actual closing prices.

This confluence of factors results in a significant spike in trading activity, particularly in the minutes leading up to the market close on MSCI rebalancing days.
