For tabs
-------

1) Also do M-x untabify in C/C++ mode to remove all tabs
2) set indent-tabs-mode to nil to disable using tabs for indentation.
   (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
3) set tab-width to 4.
4) set c-basic-offset to 4 (always to be same as tab-width)
Heres the long story. tab-width only specifies the display width. When you hit enter, the C-mode might indent using a combination of spaces and tabs. If indent-tabs-mode is nil, then indentation cannot use tabs.

Also if say c-basic-offset is 4, and tab-width is 8, then when you hit enter, it cannot insert a tab, because it will occupy 8 spaces and c-basic-offset is only set to 4.
Moreover in other editors, which cannot differentiate between tab and indentation width, you might get some strange bevahior.
So by default also set the above.

Other indentation commands:

TAB - Will insert white space or indent the current line or region in a mode specific way. The exact behavior depends on the major mode but ideally it advances to the first non-whitespace character on the preceeding line.

C-M-o : split the current line at spot.
M-m : go to first line of cursor.
M-i : indent whitespace at point
M-^ - merge with line on the previous lin
C-M-\  - Indent all lines in region.
C-x TAB:  Very nice, select a region and then use arrow keys to indent space by space if needed.
