Ok, here is the all important startup stuff.

When emacs is first started, it tries to load the a startup file for initilizing settings.
It searches for one of the following files in order
1) ~/.emacs
2) ~/.emacs.el
3) ~/.emacs.d/init.el

If any one is found, it is loaded.

Also there is a another library default.el which if available is loaded. This file is loaded after ~/.emacs
file is loaded. Although the default emacs implementation do not provide any default.el library, your sys admin
may create one. The default.el is looked up in the default search path for Lisp libraries. the default search
paths are inside /usr/local/share/emacs/ mostly. Look at load-path variable to see its value.
Also if the ~/.emacs file can inhibit loading of the default library. This is exactly what we will do. We do not
want any special default library.

Along with default, sys admin can also install a site-startup.el library in the default search lisp library paths.
This is loaded before ~/.emacs is loaded. However, we do not want this as well. To prevent this from getting loaded
we always start emacs like:

$ emacs --no-site-file

Also, we want to make sure that whenever we work on some other system or setup a new emacs, we keep our personal
keybindings and variable settings into a different file and best is to host it somewhere on the server.
Then we create ~/.emacs file in which we load our special keybinding and variable setting file).
This way if we go to our friends seat, we can quickly get our set of keybindings by just using 
M-x load-file.

We keep our settings in ~/.emacs.d/lisp/setting.el
and add ~/.emacs.d/lisp to load-path in ~/.emacs
