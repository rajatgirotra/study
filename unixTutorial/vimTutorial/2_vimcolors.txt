You can manually change any color in vim as you like using the highlight command.
the general syntax is:

:highlight Group font-key-value-pairs

example:

:highlight Comment cterm=underline ctermfg=Yello ctermbg=Cyan

To make sure highlight commands take effect, also do ":syntax enable". Every type of file c/c++/html/java/nodejs/python etc have a corresponding syntax file in /usr/share/vim/vim80/syntax. These define the meaning of the Groups
and colors are rendered accordingly.

What are Groups in highlight command? Groups define the section of the code to which the highlight command will apply
There are many groups in vim. just do ":highlight" and it will show you the current setting of all groups.

Mostly you'll play with cterm, ctermfg, ctermbg when working on terminal vim, but you may set gui, guifg, guibg
when dealing with gvim.

Also the appearance of the colors defined using the highlight commands depends on the setting of the background option.
do ":set background=dark" and ":set background=light" and see the difference for yourself.

to view the list of all the values for cterm, do ":help highlight-cterm".

Also the colors appearance depends on type of your terminal. and the number of colors supported by your terminal.
you can set the t_Co option ":set t_Co=256" to tell vim how many colors are supported in your terminal.

Now instead of manually changing colors using highlight command, you can use a colorscheme. vim ships with some default colorschemes in /usr/share/vim/vim80/colors/*.vim. You can set these using "colorscheme <name>"
