After you have studied all README'x (1-5), here is what i think we should do:

1) Get an external Harddisk
2) Install Vagrant and VirtualBox on it. Install ubuntu and CentOS virtual machines on the external HD
3) Install conda in both Virtual Box (ubuntu and CentOS).
4) Create conda-builds for python, gcc (4.8, 5 etc), boost and other libraries).
5) Copy these builds in a common location on the external HD. Say /media/usbflash/conda/packages/repos/
6) Install conda locally. Create as many working environments as you want. In the local .condarc file,
specify the path to your custom channel.

For the python installation include all modules like greenlet, quickfix, ipython, django, jinja2, arrow, python dateutil etc.

Thoroughly read http://conda.pydata.org/docs/building/bpp.html to understand details about building conda packages.
