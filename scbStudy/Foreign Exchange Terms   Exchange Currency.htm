								<p>Spot Contract.</p>
<p>A Spot Contract is the most common type of foreign currency contract. It is the real time currency price at any given time. The price is fixed although it takes two days for settlement. On receipt of cleared funds (usually BACS or CHAPS) the currency is then ready for immediate delivery (usually by Electronic Fund Transfer).</p>

<p>Fixed Term Forward Contract.</p>
<p>A Fixed Term Forward Contract can give the purchaser peace of mind and the ability to budget costs more effectively. A Fixed Term Forward Contract gives the facility to fix an exchange rate at the current market exchange rate. The delivery of the currency is then fixed for a date in the future.</p>
<p>The rate is guaranteed irrespective of the fluctuations in the currency markets. A small deposit of 5% is required to secure the forward contract and is payable within two working days. The final payment is paid in time to be cleared before the maturity of the contract. If you do not need the currency immediately we can hold it on account until required. Our competitive foreign Exchange Rates can be fixed up for up to two years in advance.</p>
<p>A Fixed Term Forward Contract or forward rate helps you effectively budget for your foreign payments as you know the exchange rate is fixed. It also helps you hedge against any fluctuations in the currency markets.</p>
<p>Forward Time Option Contract.</p>
<p>A Forward Time Option Contract is similar to a Fixed Term Forward Contract but allows for a little more flexibility. The exchange rate is fixed as per a Fixed Term Forward Contract but the currency can be transferred at any point in a fixed period and not at a fixed time. A 5% deposit is required within two days to secure the rate and final payment is made when the full foreign currency transfer is required.</p>
<p>A Forward Time Option Contract is very useful if an exact date for the transfer of foreign currency is unknown but you want a fixed exchange rate because it is favourable The best example is if you are purchasing a property overseas and the completion date is unknown.</p>
