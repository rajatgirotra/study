Components
=========
components are TypeScript classes which manage certain aspect/certain feature in your web browser.
for example you could have a header component which to have a uniform view of your web browser top of page.

We add components inside folders created in the root component. lets add a component called ServerComponent.

in src/app/server create a server.components.ts and then go there to view more.

After you manually create a component, create another component this time using "ng generate component servers" command.
Then nest two app-server components inside this servers component.
