Angular is used to create responsive single page web apps.

Angular ships with a command line interface called CLI used for creating, initializing, developing angular projects from command line
To install angular you need nodejs as a pre-requisite because cli is installed through npm (nodejs package manager)

install npm first:
sudo apt-get install npm

next install angular/cli
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli

then create your first project using cli.
cd $HOME/study/angular
ng new my-first-app # ng is the angular cli
cd my-first-app
ng serve # starts a development server on localhost on port 4200. View that in browser to make sure you are setup nicely.

the server automatically looks at changes in your source code and deploys them automatically for you. if you look at the source tree generated by "ng new" command you will see

1. a bunch of json configuration files. package.json is important which contains your project dependencies.
2. e2e folder is for end to end testing
3. node_modules is where all dependencies get installed
4. src folder is where you write source code.
5. src/app/app.component.html is the start up page you see at localhost:4200

For better source code navigation you can open your project in CLION (it allows Angular source code editing). Infact run ng serve from within clion. there is a button at the top to run CLI server.
