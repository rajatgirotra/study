<p>User with ID {{user.id}} loaded.</p>
<p>User name is {{user.name}}</p>

<a [routerLink]="['/users', '10', 'Anna']">Load Anna(10)</a> <!-- route to /users/10/Anna -->

<!--
This wont work as Angular sees that i am inside the UserComponent and that component is loaded already.
So it doesn't reload it again. As a result ngOnInit() isn't called again.
