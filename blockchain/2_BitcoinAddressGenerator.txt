Let’s start to examine how can we generate bitcoin address;

Step 1: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used to generate Private Key because Public Key Cryptography provides bitcoin’s signature principle.
ecdsaPrivateKey = ecdsa.SigningKey.generate(curve=ecdsa.SECP256k1)
print("ECDSA Private Key: ", ecdsaPrivateKey.to_string().hex())

Step 2: Due to Public Key Cryptography, we need Public Key that depends on a Private Key. So we generate it with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm too.
ecdsaPublicKey = '04' +  ecdsaPrivateKey.get_verifying_key().to_string().hex()
print("ECDSA Public Key: ", ecdsaPublicKey)
# Bitcoin uses the standard encoding for public keys, as described in http://www.secg.org/index.php?action=secg,docs_secg. The prefix byte is there to distinguish between several encodings - with 0x04 denoting uncompressed coordinates. The prefix byte will be same for all BTC networks, main or testnet.
# Correct. The public key format is managed by OpenSSL, bitcoin treats it as a black box. SEC defines three types: 0x00 = point at infinity, 0x02 and 0x03 = compressed, 0x04 = uncompressed

Step 3: We apply SHA256 to ECDSA Public Key that is created in Step 2.
hash256FromECDSAPublicKey = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(ecdsaPublicKey)).hexdigest()
print("SHA256(ECDSA Public Key): ", hash256FromECDSAPublicKey)

Step 4: We apply RIDEMP160 to value that is created in Step 3 and get value as 20 bytes.
ridemp160FromHash256 = hashlib.new('ripemd160', binascii.unhexlify(hash256FromECDSAPublicKey))
print("RIDEMP160(SHA256(ECDSA Public Key)): ", ridemp160FromHash256.hexdigest())

Step 5: We prepend 00 as Network Byte to value that is created in Step 4.
prependNetworkByte = '00' + ridemp160FromHash256.hexdigest()
print("Prepend Network Byte to RIDEMP160(SHA256(ECDSA Public Key)): ", prependNetworkByte)

Step 6: We apply double SHA256 to the value that is created in Step 5 to Checksum.
hash = prependNetworkByte
for x in range(1,3):
    hash = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(hash)).hexdigest()
    print("\t|___>SHA256 #", x, " : ", hash)

Step 7: We get 4 bytes of value that is created in Step 6 as Checksum.
cheksum = hash[:8]
print("Checksum(first 4 bytes): ", cheksum)

Step 8: We append Checksum value that is created inStep 7 to value that is created at Step #5.
appendChecksum = prependNetworkByte + cheksum
print("Append Checksum to RIDEMP160(SHA256(ECDSA Public Key)): ", appendChecksum)

Step 9: We applied Base58 Encoding to value that is created in Step 8. After Base58 Encoding, we get the value that is Bitcoin Address. (In Python, b58encode result should decode to utf-8 for showing)
bitcoinAddress = base58.b58encode(binascii.unhexlify(appendChecksum))
print("Bitcoin Address: ", bitcoinAddress.decode('utf8'))




Alternately, can also use this pypi package:
